# Testing Style Guide

Tests protect shipped behavior and should fail for the same reasons users would observe. Choose the narrowest test level that proves the contract: focused domain units for shared semantics, and real CLI, MCP, TUI, browser, server, or packaged-binary tests for surface behavior. A test named for a public surface must execute that surface rather than synthesize its output.

## Isolation

- Create a fresh directory with `createUniqueTestDir()` for every test or suite.
- Never use a shared fixed path such as `/tmp/test-project`.
- Do not pre-delete a path returned by `createUniqueTestDir()`; uniqueness is the isolation guarantee.
- Initialize Git only when the behavior under test requires Git.
- Do not read or mutate the repository backlog as fixture data.

```typescript
let testDir: string;

beforeEach(async () => {
  testDir = createUniqueTestDir("feature-name");
  await mkdir(testDir, { recursive: true });
});

afterEach(async () => {
  await safeCleanup(testDir);
});
```

## Tracked fixtures and diagnostics

- `tmp/` is ignored runtime workspace. Do not force-add generated projects, logs, dumps, screenshots, benchmark output, or one-off reproduction output.
- Retain a tracked fixture only when it is deterministic input for a named shipped, persistence, or test-harness contract. Keep it beside the owning test or in a contract-named fixture directory, and make the protected contract clear from the suite or fixture name.
- Once an incident is understood, promote a useful repro into a contract-named automated test or a documented manual procedure. Remove the incident-style copy only after reference and history searches show it is orphaned and the behavior remains reproducible.
- Before deleting a tracked diagnostic, record its provenance where recoverable, references, protected behavior, reproducibility, sensitivity, and size. Age is context, never deletion evidence.
- Never retain secrets, credentials, personal data, or machine-specific paths in fixtures or diagnostics.

## Cleanup and resource ownership

Cleanup is part of the assertion, not optional housekeeping.

- Prefer framework teardown hooks for suite-owned resources. Bun reports hook failures alongside test failures, so the primary assertion and cleanup failure remain visible.
- Do not catch and ignore `safeCleanup()`, `rm()`, server shutdown, client close, watcher stop, unsubscribe, or child-process exit failures.
- Stop watchers, servers, subscriptions, streams, clients, and child processes before removing their directories.
- If a test owns a child process, kill it when needed and await its exit.
- For a resource acquired inside a test, use `try/finally`, but do not let a cleanup exception replace the primary test exception. Capture the primary error and throw an `AggregateError` containing both when cleanup also fails.
- A best-effort catch is acceptable only when failure is the behavior being modeled, such as an existence probe returning `false`; make that fallback explicit.

```typescript
let primaryError: unknown;

try {
  await exercise(resource);
} catch (error) {
  primaryError = error;
  throw error;
} finally {
  try {
    await resource.close();
  } catch (cleanupError) {
    if (primaryError !== undefined) {
      throw new AggregateError([primaryError, cleanupError], "Test and cleanup both failed");
    }
    throw cleanupError;
  }
}
```

## Timers and asynchronous synchronization

- Synchronize on an observable event, promise, stream message, file state, or process exit.
- Do not add sleeps to make a race less likely.
- Use `withTimeout()` to bound an operation. It clears its timer when the operation resolves or rejects.
- Event waiters must clear timers and unsubscribe on success, error, timeout, and teardown.
- A timeout increase is not a lifecycle fix. Platform-specific values need evidence and a comment naming the platform risk.

```typescript
const result = await withTimeout(operation, "config loading", 5000);
```

## Global state

Tests that change `process.env`, the working directory, console methods, clocks, DOM globals, or module mocks must capture the original value and restore it in `finally` or a test hook. Keep files isolated when they intentionally mutate process-wide state.

## Assertions and surface coverage

- Prefer direct assertions over conditional or vacuous checks.
- Use known fixture data so the expected result is always present.
- Assert subprocess exit codes as well as user-visible output and persisted state.
- Do not assert private object identity or reproduce production formatting in a test helper when observable behavior is available.
- Keep legacy compatibility tests only when the CLI, MCP, configuration, instruction, or file-format contract still promises that behavior.
- Label tests of undocumented internal escape hatches as internal. Name the separate public or persisted-state test that protects the shipped contract; internal coverage is not a substitute for it.

## Platform coverage

Run portable behavior on every supported CI operating system. Use platform-specific skips only when the operating system cannot provide the underlying capability, and record the retained coverage on supported platforms. CI runs one full test job per supported operating system with the same test command and independent reporting; Windows resource pressure is not a reason to replace CLI execution with Core simulations.

## Verification

Run focused tests first, including repeated stress for lifecycle or concurrency changes. Then run the full suite, typecheck, Biome, and build. Record test counts, runtime, expected skips, and the exact platform-specific evidence used for any exception.
