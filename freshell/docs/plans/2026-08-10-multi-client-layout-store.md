**Goal:** Fix the cross-client "pane not found" bug by making the Rust server's `LayoutStore` keep one layout snapshot per connected WS client (most-recent-first), so by-id agent-API operations (rename, select, split, close, swap, and explicit-tab layout reads) resolve pane/tab ids from EVERY connected client instead of only the last writer. (Validation note: capture/send-keys/wait-for never resolve through the `LayoutStore` — they use server-global pane→session maps (`terminal_panes`/`panes`/`pane_tabs`) and were never last-writer-scoped. Their pre-existing limitation — client-UI-minted panes are not addressable via those maps in the Rust port — is orthogonal to multi-client and out of scope here.)

**Architecture:** The Rust server mirrors client layouts via WS `ui.layout.sync` frames into a shared `LayoutStore` consumed by the REST/MCP agent API. Previously the store held ONE snapshot, wholesale-replaced last-writer-wins — but pane/tab ids are minted per client (`nanoid()` in the browser) or minted server-side by the agent API and broadcast to every client via `ui.command{tab.create}`, so the same id appearing in multiple snapshots always denotes the same logical entity (validated — this is what makes multi-hit mutation sound, and in the broadcast case required), while any non-last-writer client's locally-minted ids were unresolvable. The fix replaces the single snapshot with a `Vec<ClientEntry>` keyed by WS connection id: default reads answer from the primary (index 0, last writer) only; by-id reads search all snapshots primary-first; id-targeted mutations land in every snapshot containing the id; disconnect evicts that connection's snapshot (Task 5 refines hard eviction into stale-retention, because the validated client behavior shows clients do NOT re-send `ui.layout.sync` on a silent reconnect).

**Tech Stack:** Rust (workspace crates `freshell-freshagent`, `freshell-ws`), axum (REST router), tokio + tokio-tungstenite (WS), serde_json, `std::sync::{Arc, Mutex}` store interior.

## Global Constraints

- Rust server only — the Node server intentionally retains single-snapshot behavior; every touched Node-parity doc comment marks the intentional divergence.
- No changes to the TypeScript client, Node server, or shared protocol schemas.
- Single-client behavior must remain behaviorally identical to the existing Node-parity semantics (`server/agent-api/layout-store.ts` ports, per the repo's Node-parity equivalence standard), including the `"no layout snapshot"` / `"pane not found"` / `"tab not found"` messages. Known accepted edges: on a virgin (zero-client) store, `select_tab`/`split_pane` no longer materialize an empty snapshot, so a following by-id miss reports `"no layout snapshot"` where the old port said `"pane not found"`; JS numeric-grammar corners in index targets (e.g. `Number("0x2")`) are excepted, consistent with the repo's equivalence reports.
- Never touch the live self-hosted server on port 3001; no deploy/restart from this workflow.
- No push and no PR from this workflow — local commits only, on the worktree branch.
- Red-Green-Refactor TDD: every new test is watched RED against the old single-snapshot store before implementation.
- `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo fmt --check` must be green at completion. (Known environment flake, branch-orthogonal — validated: two pre-existing `freshell-server` bin tests, `net_bind::…inflight_connection_survives_rebind…` and `network::…concurrent_configure_and_disable…`, race under parallel execution on WSL2 (in-source note at `crates/freshell-server/src/network.rs:2405-2411`); they pass isolated / with `--test-threads=1` / on rerun. Do not chase them; verify workspace green modulo that pair.)

## Task 1: Layout store core — per-client snapshots

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/layout_store.rs`
- Test: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/layout_store_tests.rs` (included via `#[path = "layout_store_tests.rs"] mod tests;` at `layout_store.rs:1181`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `freshell_protocol::UiLayoutSync` (WS layout frame), existing `UiSnapshot` / `TabRow` / `PaneNode` internals, existing helpers `find_pane_tab`, `single_pane_id`, `set_sticky_title`, `leaves_of`.
- Produces (exact signatures from the committed code):
  - `struct ClientEntry { key: String, snapshot: UiSnapshot }` — one connected client's mirrored snapshot.
  - `struct LayoutInner { clients: Vec<ClientEntry> }` — most-recent-first; index 0 is the PRIMARY (last writer). Replaces the old single-snapshot inner.
  - `const SERVER_CLIENT_KEY: &str = "__server__";` — bootstrap entry for server-side `create_tab` on an empty store; superseded (evicted) by the first real client sync.
  - `pub fn update_from_ui(&self, sync: &freshell_protocol::UiLayoutSync, source_connection_id: &str)` — REPLACES this client's snapshot and makes it the primary.
  - `pub fn remove_client(&self, client_key: &str)` — drops that client's snapshot; primary falls back to the most recently synced remaining client.
  - `pub fn pane_is_sole_in_tab(&self, pane_id: &str) -> bool` — the `tabRenamed` check, answered from the snapshot where the pane actually resolves.
  - `pub(crate) fn snapshots_clone(&self) -> Vec<UiSnapshot>` — clones of every snapshot, primary first, for read-only walkers (target resolver).
  - Reworked reads: `pub fn list_tabs(&self) -> (Vec<Value>, Option<String>)` (primary-only), `pub fn list_panes(&self, tab_id: Option<&str>) -> Result<Vec<PaneRow>, &'static str>` (default tab primary-only; explicit tab id searches all snapshots), `pub fn get_pane_snapshot(&self, pane_id: &str) -> Option<PaneSnapshot>`, `pub fn has_tab(&self, target: &str) -> bool`, `pub fn get_single_pane_id(&self, tab_id: &str) -> Option<String>` (all-snapshot, primary-first).
  - Reworked mutations (`rename_pane`, `rename_tab`, `close_tab`, `select_tab`, `select_pane`, `swap_pane`, `split_pane`, `attach_pane_content`, `close_pane`, `resize_split`): apply to EVERY snapshot containing the id; outcome reports the first (most-recent) match. E.g. `pub fn rename_pane(&self, pane_id: &str, title: &str) -> RenameOutcome`.
  - `"no layout snapshot"` is returned only when `clients` is empty (Node parity).

**Steps:**

- [x] Write failing store-level tests in `layout_store_tests.rs` (multi-client section, with a `client_sync(tab_id, tab_title, pane_id, ts)` helper building one-tab/one-pane syncs per simulated client):
  - `rename_pane_resolves_ids_from_any_client_snapshot` — THE reported bug. Key assertion:
    ```rust
    store.update_from_ui(&client_sync("tA", "Desktop", "pA", 1), "conn-a");
    store.update_from_ui(&client_sync("tB", "Phone", "pB", 2), "conn-b"); // last writer
    let out = store.rename_pane("pA", "Renamed A");
    assert_eq!(out.message, None, "pane from a non-primary client snapshot must resolve");
    ```
    plus `list_tabs()` stays primary-only (`rows[0]["id"] == json!("tB")`).
  - `by_id_reads_and_mutations_resolve_across_clients` — `get_pane_snapshot("pA")`, `list_panes(Some("tA"))`, `has_tab("tA")`/`has_tab("Desktop")`, `resolve_target(&store, "pA")`, then `split_pane`/`close_pane`/`select_pane`/`rename_tab` all resolve conn-a ids while conn-b is primary.
  - `rename_pane_updates_every_client_snapshot_containing_the_id` — two same-origin windows sync the same ids; after `rename_pane("p1", "Both")` and `remove_client("conn-b")` (the primary), `get_normalized_snapshot(None)["paneTitles"]["t1"]["p1"] == json!("Both")` — multi-hit mutation survives primary eviction.
  - `remove_client_evicts_and_primary_falls_back_to_most_recent_remaining` — after `remove_client("conn-b")`, `list_tabs()` answers from conn-a; `rename_pane("pB", "X").message == Some("pane not found")`; evicting the last client yields `Some("no layout snapshot")`.
  - `sole_pane_check_uses_the_snapshot_where_the_pane_resolves` — same tab id `T` is a two-pane split in conn-a but single-pane in conn-b (primary); `pane_is_sole_in_tab("pB")` is true, `pane_is_sole_in_tab("p1")` is false.
  - `update_from_ui_still_replaces_the_same_clients_snapshot` — single-client parity guard: a re-sync from the same `conn-a` replaces its own snapshot (`rename_pane("p1", "X").message == Some("pane not found")` for the superseded ids).
- [x] Run to verify RED against the old single-snapshot store: `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent --lib layout_store::tests::rename_pane_resolves_ids_from_any_client_snapshot` — observed failure: `out.message` was `Some("pane not found")` (conn-b's sync had wholesale-replaced the store). Validation note (Stage 2, corrected): of the other five, the tests exercising `remove_client`/`pane_is_sole_in_tab` discriminate via COMPILE failure against the fork-point store (those APIs did not exist yet), `update_from_ui_still_replaces_the_same_clients_snapshot` is a single-client parity guard rather than a behavioral RED, and the rest failed behaviorally (pA unresolvable via conn-a; title lost after primary eviction; sole-pane answered from the wrong snapshot).
- [x] Implement: replace the single-snapshot `LayoutInner` with `clients: Vec<ClientEntry>` plus accessors `primary()`, `primary_mut()`, `snapshots()`, `snapshots_mut()`, and `ensure_primary()` (server bootstrap via `SERVER_CLIENT_KEY`). Rework `update_from_ui` to replace only `source_connection_id`'s entry and move it to index 0 (evicting the `__server__` bootstrap entry on the first real sync). Convert by-id reads to primary-first all-snapshot search and mutations to multi-hit application, e.g. `rename_pane`:
    ```rust
    let mut first: Option<String> = None;
    for snapshot in inner.snapshots_mut() {
        let Some(tab_id) = find_pane_tab(snapshot, pane_id) else { continue };
        set_sticky_title(snapshot, &tab_id, pane_id, title);
        ...
        first.get_or_insert(tab_id);
    }
    ```
    Add `remove_client` (`clients.retain(|entry| entry.key != client_key)`), `pane_is_sole_in_tab` (`leaves_of(snapshot, &tab_id).len() == 1` in the resolving snapshot), and `snapshots_clone`. Update the `LayoutInner` doc comment to document the intentional divergence from Node's single-snapshot store (`server/agent-api/layout-store.ts` — single-snapshot field at `:49`, wholesale-replace `updateFromUi` at `:169-181`; the committed comment's `layout-store.ts:44-46` anchor mis-points at `emptySnapshot()` — Task 4 corrects it).
- [x] Run to verify GREEN: `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent --lib layout_store` — all `layout_store::tests` pass (`test result: ok`), including the pre-existing single-client suite unchanged.
- [x] Commit — landed as part of the single atomic commit `b9e1fa4f0` ("fix(rust-server): multi-client layout store resolves pane ids from every client"). All three tasks were implemented and committed together, not as separate commits; this step records that honestly rather than inventing per-task SHAs.

## Task 2: WS ingestion keyed by connection id + disconnect eviction

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs` (sync ingestion + disconnect teardown)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/lib.rs` (`WsState.layout` doc comment — intentional-divergence note)
- Test: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/ui_layout_sync.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `freshell_freshagent::layout_store::LayoutStore` (Task 1's `update_from_ui` / `remove_client` / read surface), the WS serve loop's per-connection `conn_id`, `ClientMessage::UiLayoutSync(sync)`.
- Produces: connection-keyed ingestion and eviction inside the existing socket lifecycle:
  - `handle_client_text`'s `ClientMessage::UiLayoutSync` arm: `state.layout.update_from_ui(&sync, &conn_id.to_string());` (no reply frame — Node sends none).
  - `run()`'s disconnect teardown: `state.layout.remove_client(&conn_id.to_string());` alongside the existing `registry.remove_connection(conn_id)`.
  - Known accepted limitation: teardown runs on every non-panic termination path (all `select!` arms exit via `break` to it); a panic inside the WS task skips teardown entirely — a pre-existing pattern that equally skips `registry.remove_connection` and session-lease release. Accepted for this change; recommended follow-up (out of scope): one RAII drop guard covering all teardown steps.

**Steps:**

- [x] Write the failing integration test `two_client_syncs_coexist_rest_resolves_non_primary_ids_and_disconnect_evicts` in `crates/freshell-ws/tests/ui_layout_sync.rs`: two REAL `/ws` connections (harness convention from `session_identity_frames.rs`; `ping`/`pong` on the same connection as the ordering barrier) sync different layouts (conn-1: tab `t1`/pane `p1`; conn-2, last writer: tab `t2`/pane `p2`); a real REST `PATCH /api/panes/p1` against a router sharing the SAME `LayoutStore` must succeed. Key assertions:
    ```rust
    assert_eq!(resp.status(), 200);
    assert_eq!(body["data"]["paneId"], serde_json::json!("p1"));
    ...
    assert_eq!(tabs.len(), 1, "list_tabs reads the primary snapshot only");
    assert_eq!(tabs[0]["id"], serde_json::json!("t2"));
    ...
    assert!(evicted, "disconnect must evict the closed client's snapshot");
    ```
    After conn-1 closes, `p1` no longer resolves while `layout.get_pane_snapshot("p2").is_some()` still holds.
- [x] Run to verify RED: `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test ui_layout_sync two_client_syncs_coexist_rest_resolves_non_primary_ids_and_disconnect_evicts` — observed failure: REST returned 200 with body `{"message":"pane not found"}` (conn-2's sync had replaced the shared snapshot, so `p1` was unresolvable).
- [x] Implement: pass `&conn_id.to_string()` as `update_from_ui`'s `source_connection_id` in the `UiLayoutSync` arm (the port of Node's `this.layoutStore.updateFromUi(m, ws.connectionId || 'unknown')` — validated at `server/ws-handler.ts:2026`, arm `:2024-2039`, no reply frame confirmed; the previously cited `:1966-1969` is the `hello` arm); add `state.layout.remove_client(&conn_id.to_string())` to `run()`'s disconnect teardown; update the `ui.layout.sync` arm comment, the disconnect comment, and `WsState.layout`'s doc in `lib.rs` to state the intentional multi-client divergence from Node's single last-writer-wins snapshot. Update the pre-existing `ui_layout_sync_frame_populates_the_shared_layout_store` test's doc to the per-connection wording.
- [x] Run to verify GREEN: `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test ui_layout_sync` — both tests pass (`test result: ok`).
- [x] Commit — landed in the same atomic commit `b9e1fa4f0` (see Task 1's commit step; the three tasks shipped as one commit).

---

## Task 3: REST handler integration — tabRenamed, rename cascade, target resolver

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/lib.rs` (the `rename_pane` REST handler for `PATCH /api/panes/:id`)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/target_resolver.rs`
- Test: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/rename_cascade_tests.rs` (included via `#[path = "rename_cascade_tests.rs"] mod rename_cascade_tests;` at `lib.rs:3254`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1's `LayoutStore::{rename_pane, pane_is_sole_in_tab, get_pane_snapshot, snapshots_clone}`.
- Produces (exact signatures from the committed code):
  - `pub fn resolve_target(store: &LayoutStore, raw: &str) -> ResolvedTarget` — now iterates `store.snapshots_clone()`; empty store short-circuits to `ResolvedTarget::NotFound("no layout snapshot")`; a primary miss's message is preserved via `miss.get_or_insert(...)`.
  - `fn resolve_in_snapshot(snapshot: &UiSnapshot, raw: &str) -> ResolvedTarget` — the full Node resolution ladder (pane id → tab by id OR title in one combined pass over tabs in order, duplicate titles first-wins → `tab.pane` index form → bare index → pane title, 2+ matches → Ambiguous) extracted to run against ONE client snapshot; the ladder runs per snapshot, primary first, behaviorally identical to Node with one client connected (per the repo's equivalence standard; JS numeric-grammar corners like `Number("0x2")` excepted).
  - REST `rename_pane` handler: `tabRenamed` computed as `let tab_renamed = state.layout.pane_is_sole_in_tab(&pane_id);` (replacing the old `list_panes(Some(&tab_id)).map(|rows| rows.len() == 1)` read, which would answer from the wrong snapshot when another client has a same-id tab of different shape); the rename cascade (`rename_persistence::persist_syncable_terminal_rename`) receives the pane snapshot from `get_pane_snapshot`, which uses the same primary-first search as the rename. Validation note: the handler takes three separate store locks (with an await between), so a concurrently interleaved `ui.layout.sync` can reorder the store between calls — verified benign (worst case: a mislabeled `tabRenamed` flag in one response; no in-repo consumer reads it).

**Steps:**

- [x] Write the failing handler test `rename_from_non_primary_client_succeeds_and_tab_renamed_uses_that_snapshot` in `rename_cascade_tests.rs` (adding a `seed_layout_as(state, payload, conn_id)` variant of the existing `seed_layout` helper): conn-a syncs tab `t1` as a SINGLE-pane tab holding `p1`; conn-b (primary) syncs the SAME tab id `t1` with TWO panes `b1`/`b2`. Key assertions:
    ```rust
    let (status, body) = patch_pane(crate::router(state.clone()), "p1", "Cross Client").await;
    assert_eq!(status, StatusCode::OK, "{body}");
    assert_eq!(body["data"]["tabRenamed"], json!(true),
        "tabRenamed must come from conn-a's snapshot (single-pane t1), not \
         the primary's two-pane t1: {body}");
    ```
    plus the primary's `b1` rename returns `tabRenamed == json!(false)`, and both renames broadcast `ui.command{pane.rename}`.
- [x] Run to verify RED: `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent --lib rename_cascade_tests::rename_from_non_primary_client_succeeds_and_tab_renamed_uses_that_snapshot` — observed failure: 200 with the Node-parity miss body `{"status":"ok","data":{"message":"pane not found"},"message":"pane not found"}` (no `tabId`/`paneId`/`tabRenamed` fields), because `p1` existed only in the non-last-writer's snapshot.
- [x] Implement: in `lib.rs`'s `rename_pane` handler, replace the `list_panes`-based `tabRenamed` computation with `state.layout.pane_is_sole_in_tab(&pane_id)` and update the handler's step-5 doc comment (multi-client note). In `target_resolver.rs`, split the ladder into `resolve_in_snapshot` and make `resolve_target` iterate `store.snapshots_clone()` primary-first, preserving the primary's miss message (`miss.expect("at least one snapshot was checked")` when nothing resolves). `by_id_reads_and_mutations_resolve_across_clients` (Task 1) covers the resolver's cross-client behavior via `resolve_target(&store, "pA")`.
- [x] Run to verify GREEN: `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent --lib` — full crate lib suite passes, 420/420 (`test result: ok. 420 passed; 0 failed`).
- [x] Final verification as originally run: `cargo test --workspace` green (including `freshell-ws` integration tests 2/2). **Stage-2 validation correction (claim falsified at HEAD):** `cargo clippy` shows 2 warnings (`layout_store.rs:414` doc-lazy-continuation — the same lint class main fixed in e6e958406; `target_resolver.rs:159` needless borrow) and `cargo fmt --check` shows 3 diffs (`layout_store_tests.rs:699/:765`, `ui_layout_sync.rs:319`). Re-verified green: lib suite 420/420, ui_layout_sync 2/2, workspace green modulo the two known-flaky pre-existing `freshell-server` bin tests (see Global Constraints). The clippy/fmt gates are closed by Task 4. Fresh-eyes iteration 1 additionally reworded the commit message itself (now `b9e1fa4f0`) — it originally claimed "Full workspace suite, clippy, and fmt are clean"; the reworded message states the clippy/fmt gates are NOT closed by that commit and defers them to Task 4's follow-up commit.
- [x] Commit — landed in the same atomic commit `b9e1fa4f0` on `fix/multi-client-layout-store` (8 files, +906/−269). No push, no PR (per repo rules and Global Constraints).

## Task 4: Close the remaining by-id read gap + gate hygiene (added by Stage-2 load-bearing validation)

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/layout_store.rs` (`get_normalized_snapshot` at `:279`, divergence doc-comment anchor at `:70`, clippy doc-lazy-continuation at `:414`)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/target_resolver.rs` (clippy needless borrow at `:159`)
- Format only: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/layout_store_tests.rs`, `crates/freshell-ws/tests/ui_layout_sync.rs` (`cargo fmt`)
- Test: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/layout_store_tests.rs`

**Why:** Validation falsified the completeness claim narrowly: `GET /api/layout/snapshot?tabId=` (`get_normalized_snapshot(Some(tab_id))`) still answers from the PRIMARY snapshot only — the one remaining by-id agent-API read where a non-last-writer client's tab id is unresolvable. Also: the clippy/fmt gates are currently red, and the committed divergence comment cites the wrong Node anchor.

**Steps:**

- [x] Write the failing test `normalized_snapshot_with_explicit_tab_id_resolves_from_any_client_snapshot` in `layout_store_tests.rs` (reuse the `client_sync` helper): conn-a syncs tab `tA`/pane `pA`; conn-b (primary, last writer) syncs `tB`/`pB`. Assert `get_normalized_snapshot(Some("tA"))` returns conn-a's tab content, and `get_normalized_snapshot(None)` stays primary-only (answers from `tB`).
- [x] Run to verify RED: `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent --lib layout_store` — the explicit-tab assertion fails against the primary-only read. Observed: `snap["tabs"][0]["id"]` was `Null` (the primary, conn-b, has no `tA`; body was the empty tab view), 22 passed / 1 failed.
- [x] Implement: make `get_normalized_snapshot(Some(tab_id))` search all snapshots primary-first (same pattern as explicit-tab `list_panes`); the default `None` path stays primary-only. Update the method's doc comment with the multi-client note.
- [x] Fix the divergence doc-comment anchor at `layout_store.rs:70`: cite `server/agent-api/layout-store.ts` (single-snapshot field `:49`, wholesale-replace `updateFromUi` `:169-181`) instead of `layout-store.ts:44-46`; likewise correct any `ws-handler.ts:1966-1969` doc references in `crates/freshell-ws` (if present) to `server/ws-handler.ts:2024-2027`. (Corrected: `terminal.rs:860`, `lib.rs:177`, `tests/ui_layout_sync.rs:8`, plus the same-comment stale sidebar-recompute anchor `ws:1970-1979` → `ws:2028-2037` and the tests-file divergence anchor `layout-store.ts:44-46` → `:49`/`:169-181`. The `layout-store.ts:44-46` cite in `get_normalized_snapshot`'s own doc correctly anchors `emptySnapshot()` and stays.)
- [x] Fix clippy: doc-lazy-continuation at `layout_store.rs:414`; needless borrow at `target_resolver.rs:159`. Run `cargo fmt` (3 known diffs in the two test files above).
- [x] Run to verify GREEN: `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent --lib` all pass (421/421); `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test ui_layout_sync` 2/2; `cargo clippy -p freshell-freshagent -p freshell-ws --all-targets` clean (0 warnings); `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- [x] Commit (focused, atomic; no push, no PR).

## Task 5: Reconnect-window resilience — stale-snapshot retention (added by Stage-2 load-bearing validation)

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/layout_store.rs` (`ClientEntry` staleness, `remove_client`, `update_from_ui`, primary selection, `pub` entry-count/staleness probes)
- Test: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/layout_store_tests.rs` (new tests + assertion updates to the Task 1 eviction tests)
- Modify (disconnect-phase redesign — new positive barriers, NOT a bare assertion flip): `crates/freshell-ws/tests/ui_layout_sync.rs` (disconnect expectations)

**Why (validated, falsified assumption):** The unmodified TS client's ONLY `ui.layout.sync` sender is `layoutMirrorMiddleware.ts` — change-gated (`if (serialized === lastPayload) return`) and debounced, with `lastPayload` never reset on reconnect; neither server requests a sync on hello. So after a silent WS reconnect (new conn-id, unchanged layout), hard evict-on-disconnect leaves that client's ids unresolvable for an UNBOUNDED window (until the next layout change or a page reload) — transiently re-opening the reported bug for exactly the multi-device users it targets (mobile background/sleep, keepalive drops). Client/protocol changes are out of bounds (Global Constraints), so the mitigation is server-side retention. Retention also restores Node's post-disconnect utility (Node retains its snapshot forever; validation flagged hard-evict as a regression for agent workflows that run after the last UI client closes).

**Design (server-only):**
- `ClientEntry` gains `stale: bool` (false on every live sync).
- `remove_client(key)` marks the entry stale instead of dropping it.
- A stale entry is never primary while any live entry exists; if ONLY stale entries remain, the most recent one still answers default reads (Node-parity post-disconnect behavior). `"no layout snapshot"` only when the store is truly empty.
- Supersede-eviction (SUBSET rule): when `update_from_ui` applies a live sync, drop a STALE entry only if EVERY pane id in that stale snapshot also appears in the incoming sync. Eviction is then lossless by construction — every evicted id remains resolvable via the live entry — so it needs no same-client inference at all. Mere one-id overlap is NOT sufficient evidence of "same client": same-id means same logical ENTITY, not same client — server-minted agent-API ids are broadcast to EVERY client via `ui.command{tab.create}` (so after any agent-API tab creation, every client's snapshot shares that id), and same-origin windows can share localStorage-persisted ids. A one-id-overlap predicate would let any live client's next sync evict a DIFFERENT disconnected client's stale entry and silently discard its unique locally-minted ids during exactly the silent-reconnect window this task protects. A stale entry holding any pane id NOT covered by the incoming sync is retained (until a covering sync arrives, or the cap drops it). The reconnect case still works: a reconnected client's re-sync carries the same layout, so its old entry's ids are fully covered and it is evicted.
- Cap stale entries at 4 (drop oldest beyond the cap) as a growth safety valve.
- By-id reads and mutations treat stale entries exactly like live ones (that is the point).
- Test/diagnostic probes: add `pub fn client_entry_count(&self) -> usize` and `pub fn stale_entry_count(&self) -> usize` to `LayoutStore`. The WS integration test uses these as its disconnect-processed and supersede-processed barriers; they do not exist on the old store, so probe-using tests are compile-fail RED there (Task 1's validated precedent for API-introducing tests).

**Steps:**

- [x] Write failing tests in `layout_store_tests.rs`:
  - `disconnected_clients_ids_stay_resolvable_until_superseded` — conn-a syncs `tA`/`pA`; `remove_client("conn-a")`; `rename_pane("pA", "X").message == None` (still resolves); then a live sync under a NEW conn id whose snapshot covers ALL of the stale entry's pane ids (here just `pA`) evicts the stale entry: `stale_entry_count() == 0` and exactly one entry containing `pA` remains.
  - `live_sync_sharing_only_broadcast_ids_does_not_evict_another_clients_stale_entry` — the false-positive guard for the subset rule (extend the `client_sync` helper, or add a two-pane sibling, to build a two-pane tab): conn-a syncs a tab holding panes `pA` + `pS`; conn-b syncs a different tab holding `pB` + `pS` (`pS` models a server-minted id broadcast to every client); `remove_client("conn-a")`; conn-b live-syncs again (still containing `pS`, never `pA`). The shared-id overlap must NOT evict conn-a's stale entry: `rename_pane("pA", "Still Here").message == None` and `stale_entry_count() == 1`.
  - `stale_entry_never_primary_while_live_clients_exist` — a live client wins `list_tabs()` even if the stale entry synced later; with only stale entries left, the most recent stale answers default reads.
  - `stale_cap_bounds_growth` — 5 disconnected distinct clients → oldest dropped, 4 retained.
- [x] Run to verify RED against the current hard-evict store: `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent --lib layout_store` — retention, guard, and cap tests fail behaviorally there (ids unresolvable / entries gone the moment `remove_client` runs); assertions using the new probes additionally fail to COMPILE (`stale_entry_count` does not exist yet) — a discriminating compile-fail RED, per the Task 1 precedent.
- [x] Implement per the design. Update existing end-state assertions to retention semantics: `remove_client_evicts_and_primary_falls_back_to_most_recent_remaining` (primary falls back to the most recent LIVE entry; a fully-stale store still answers default reads; `"no layout snapshot"` only for a truly empty store).
- [x] Redesign `ui_layout_sync.rs`'s disconnect phase around POSITIVE disconnect-processed barriers. The old `get_pane_snapshot("p1").is_none()` poll was the only proof the disconnect path ran; a bare inversion ("`p1` still resolvable") would pass vacuously before the server even processes the close (it would pass with `remove_client` deleted outright), so it is forbidden here. New sequence, each step gated before the next: (1) re-sync conn-1 LAST so it becomes primary and `list_tabs()` answers `t1`; (2) close conn-1, then poll until `layout.stale_entry_count() == 1` AND `list_tabs()` answers `t2` — stale-never-primary makes the primary flip the behavioral proof the close was processed; (3) only then assert retention: `layout.get_pane_snapshot("p1").is_some()`; (4) open a THIRD connection and sync conn-1's exact layout (`t1`/`p1`, covering all of the stale entry's ids), then poll until `stale_entry_count() == 0` as the supersede barrier. Do NOT use conn-2's sync as the superseder — it never contains `p1`, and under the subset rule it must not evict. Because step (2)'s barrier completes before step (4) begins, the supersede sync can never race the close processing. Against the old store this test is compile-fail RED (no probes) rather than a racy behavioral watch.
- [x] Run to verify GREEN: `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent --lib`, `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test ui_layout_sync`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check`.
- [x] Commit (focused, atomic; no push, no PR).

## Validated residual caveats (documented and accepted by Stage-2 load-bearing validation)

- **Resolver precedence shadowing (accepted):** the full resolution ladder runs per snapshot primary-first, so a fuzzy match in the primary (an exact tab-title match, or an all-digit bare index) wins before a secondary snapshot's exact pane/tab id is consulted, and cross-snapshot title collisions never yield `Ambiguous`. Accepted because a collision requires a human-facing title or digit string to exactly equal another client's nanoid-format id — improbable — and reordering the tested resolver (cross-snapshot exact-id pass first) was judged not worth the churn. Deliberate; documented here.
- **Primary-only listings vs by-id resolution asymmetry (deliberate):** `list_tabs`/default `list_panes` show only the last writer's layout while by-id ops resolve across all clients; MCP tool descriptions promise "list all tabs", so an agent may successfully act by id on a pane that listings don't show. Matches Node default-read semantics; kept.
- **`resize_split` writes primary-derived sizes onto every snapshot containing the id** — mirror-only divergence that self-heals at each client's next sync. (The store is validated non-authoritative: nothing persists it or restores clients from it; the only store-driven disk write is the best-effort title override in the rename cascade.)
- **`tabRenamed` has no in-repo consumer** (`PaneContainer.tsx:312-321` ignores it); its cross-client "resolving snapshot wins" semantics are pinned by test and benign.
- **Deployment-path flag:** the repo's documented default server is still Node (`npm run serve`, `bin: freshell`, Electron bundle); the Rust server is opt-in (`run-rust-server.sh`), with direction toward Rust (rust-port-mainline #633). This fix helps Rust-server deployments; the Node store intentionally stays single-snapshot per Global Constraints.
- **Exotic parity drift (noted, not gating):** Rust `js_number` ≠ JS `Number()` for `0x/0o/0b` strings in the bare-index rung; Node `selectTab` materializes an empty snapshot where Rust doesn't. Single-client parity for error strings, ladder rung order, and miss-message precedence is otherwise verified line-by-line.
