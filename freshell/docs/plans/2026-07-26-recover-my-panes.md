**Goal:** When a browser connects with no local layout while the server holds recoverable state (pane-identity ledger bindings and/or tabs-snapshots), offer the user "Restore N panes from server memory?" — accept recreates the panes (snapshot = layout, ledger = identity per the §4.2 authority chain), decline is remembered. This resolves campaign item P1.9 and kata h9vt.

**Architecture:** A new authenticated `GET /api/recovery/inventory` endpoint (axum, `crates/freshell-server/src/recovery_inventory.rs`) joins the newest tabs-snapshot generation union (excluding the requesting client's own pushes and stale rotated clients) with pane-ledger bindings and read-only terminal-registry liveness, and returns a recoverable inventory. The client captures "had persisted layout at boot" at module load, fetches the inventory when eligible, and shows a self-gating offer panel; accept recreates tabs client-side through the existing `addTab` + `restoreLayout` path (the same path `reopenClosedTab` uses). The operator-only `POST /api/tabs-sync/restore` endpoint and its marker/fence machinery are deleted (kata h9vt Option A disposition, see below).

**Tech Stack:** Rust (axum 0.8, tokio, serde_json), React 18 + Redux Toolkit + Vitest/Testing Library, Playwright e2e with owned `RustServer` instances.

## Kata h9vt Disposition (decided during planning — state in the final report)

**Option A — the tabs-snapshots store becomes load-bearing.** Snapshots are the only durable source of *layout* (the ledger has identity but no layout; localStorage is exactly what's lost in the browser-loss scenario), so ledger-only recovery (Option B) cannot restore tabs/splits/cwd — the store stays.

Within Option A, per the directive "reuse what serves the UI flow, DELETE what doesn't":
- **REUSED:** the write path (`tabs_persist.rs`, untouched), the read selectors (`list_snapshot_devices`, `read_device_overview`, `read_generations_union_by_ids`) which feed the new inventory endpoint, and the `GET /api/tabs-sync/snapshots[/{device_id}]` HTTP read API together with `parse_selector` + `Selector` (`tabs_snapshots_selectors.rs`), which its surviving `get_snapshot` handler consumes at `tabs_snapshots.rs:129` — external consumers: `scripts/deploy-tab-diff.sh:53,66,88` curls those endpoints, and the read tests cover them.
- **DELETED (Task 9):** `POST /api/tabs-sync/restore`, the write-ahead marker module (`tabs_snapshots_marker.rs`), the exactly-one-browser gate, the screenshot delivery-fence (explicitly flagged for deletion — an unreachable fence is context poison), `scripts/restore-tabs.sh`, and `tabs_snapshots_create_body.rs`. Rationale: all of that machinery exists to make a *blind server-push* to an operator-invisible browser safe. The UI flow is client-driven — the client fetches the inventory and recreates panes itself through the normal create path — so there is no server-push, no ambiguous target browser, nothing for a marker or fence to protect.

## Design Decisions

**D1 — Trigger conditions (Principle 4 compliance).** The offer appears iff ALL of:
1. `localStorage` had NO layout key (`freshell.layout.v3` and `freshell.layout.v3.bak` both absent) **captured at module load**, before the asynchronous writers — the auto-shell-tab (`App.tsx:1423-1427`) and the 500 ms persist debounce — can write one, OR a pending-offer flag from a prior undecided visit is set (see D3). Synchronous module-load writers of `freshell.layout.v3` DO exist (`storage-migration.ts:332/431`, self-executing via `main.tsx`'s side-effect import at `main.tsx:4`, and `migrateV2ToV3` at `persistedState.ts:594` during tabsSlice module eval), but each fires only when durable layout data ALREADY existed — so key-presence at boot-state module eval remains the correct "had layout" signal, and the capture design stands. Two invariants are pinned in Task 3: `import '@/store/storage-migration'` stays ahead of the `@/store/store` and `@/App` imports in `main.tsx` (the only imports above it — react, react-dom/client, react-redux — are pure library imports with no localStorage side effects; storage-migration re-materializes `freshell.layout.v3` from the `.backup-before-fresh-agent-centralization` key before capture — which is why boot-state checks only v3 + .bak), and `boot-state.ts` is never imported from `main.tsx` at all.
2. `GET /api/recovery/inventory` reports `recoverable: true`.
3. The inventory `contentId` is not in the dismissed list.

Consequences: *empty-never* and *empty-cleared* browsers (both have no layout key) get the offer — correct, both are genuinely new-browser situations. *Same-browser reload with intact localStorage* (key present) never sees the offer — even if the user deliberately closed all tabs (key present, zero tabs). Principle 4 ("never ask when we can act") is not violated: an empty client layout gives the server no client claim to adjudicate; silently materializing another device's layout onto a possibly-brand-new user's browser would be "silently wrong," so offering is the correct reading (the campaign plan's §4.4 itself says "offer"). `serverInstanceId` is NOT part of the trigger — snapshots and the ledger persist across restarts, and `restoreLayout` strips live-attach fields anyway.

**D2 — Self-pollution filter.** A fresh browser context mints a fresh per-window `clientInstanceId` (sessionStorage) and starts pushing snapshots (auto shell tab) within seconds. The inventory request carries `?clientInstanceId=<current>`; the server excludes that client's generations when building each device union, so the requester's own junk pushes never appear as "recoverable." (A fresh browser also mints a fresh `deviceId`, so its pushes usually land in a different device dir — the filter covers the selective-clear case where the deviceId survived.) The per-window exclusion alone is NOT enough: opening the fresh browser with TWO windows (routine — session-restore of pinned tabs) makes each window's junk pushes *foreign* to the other window's request, and since they carry the newest `capturedAt` by construction they would win primary-device selection and demote the genuinely lost device to `otherDevices` (which accept does not restore). Therefore the request ALSO carries `bootAgoMs` — the elapsed milliseconds since the D1 boot-state capture (a DURATION, so client/server clock skew is irrelevant; for a D3 pending re-offer, elapsed since the ORIGINAL capture time persisted with the pending flag). The server computes `boot_cutoff = now_ms() - bootAgoMs` and drops every client ALL of whose retained generations have `capturedAt >= boot_cutoff` (the A16 concurrent-client rule in Task 1): a client that first pushed after this browser session booted is by definition not lost data — it is a concurrently-opened fresh window (or other concurrently-born client), never the lost device, whose clients' pushes ALL predate the fresh boot (so generation-retention depth cannot misclassify a real client). `capturedAt` is server-stamped at generation write time (`tabs_persist.rs:812-821`), so the comparison is server-clock-only.

**D3 — Dismissal + pending persistence.** Decline writes the inventory `contentId` to `localStorage["freshell.recovery.dismissed.v1"]` (array, capped at 20). While the offer is shown but undecided, `localStorage["freshell.recovery.pending.v1"] = JSON.stringify({contentId, bootAt})` (where `bootAt` is the boot-state capture `Date.now()`) so a reload mid-decision (which by then has a persisted auto-tab layout) re-offers instead of silently losing the recovery chance — and the re-offer derives `bootAgoMs` from the ORIGINAL `bootAt`, keeping D2's concurrent-client filter anchored to the pre-junk moment; accept/decline clears it. "Decline is remembered" means: remembered until the recoverable SUBSTANCE changes. The `contentId` is a sha256 over timestamp-free substance (Task 1), so a dismissal survives server heartbeat re-pushes (which stamp a new `capturedAt` every ≤5 min whenever a second client is connected), server restarts, and Rust upgrades; only a real change to the recoverable panes/sessions re-offers.

**D4 — Authority chain (§4.2): ledger identity beats snapshot claim.** For each snapshot pane with a `sessionRef`, the server joins the ledger and reports a verdict; the client uses `effectiveSessionRef`:
- ledger row chain (following `supersededBy`, max 10 hops) ends at a `bound` row → resume the **ledger's** `{provider, sessionId}` (snapshot claim overridden).
- row `retired` with reason `gc_expired` (no live successor) → keep the snapshot ref; the resume happens via the direct wire-`sessionRef` rung in the WS create handler (`terminal.rs:1047`, `:1074-1078`) — the `createRequestId`-keyed ladder (including `pane_ledger_auto_resume`) never runs when a `sessionRef` is sent.
- row `retired` with reason `closed` → no resume; recreate a fresh pane in the same cwd/mode.
- no ledger row (e.g. fresh-agent sessions — the ledger has no rows for them) → the snapshot claim stands.

Claude resume requires canonical-UUID session ids (`is_canonical_claude_session_id`, `terminal.rs:1652-1660`): a non-canonical claude ref fails LOUD per-pane with `RestoreUnavailable` (`terminal.rs:1104-1117`) — acceptable, not silent.

Bound ledger rows whose `(provider, sessionId)` matches no **effective** pane ref in ANY device union (not just the primary) and that are not owned by a currently-Running terminal (see D7) are returned as `ledgerOnly` and recreated in an extra "Recovered sessions" tab, so ledger-known sessions are never dropped just because layout was lost. Residual: primary-device selection is argmax `capturedAt` and can pick a device the user didn't lose. Same-fresh-browser multi-window junk can NOT win primary — every concurrent window's client is born after the boot cutoff and is dropped by D2's `bootAgoMs` concurrent-client filter — so the residual is only a genuinely pre-existing OTHER device (e.g. a second machine still connected) out-winning the lost one; mitigation — the offer shows `deviceLabel` + `otherDevices`, and decline is cheap.

**D5 — Recreation path.** Accept dispatches, per inventory tab: `addTab({id: nanoid(), title: tabName})` then `restoreLayout({tabId, layout, paneTitles})` — the exact path `reopenClosedTab` already exercises. `restoreLayout` re-mints `createRequestId`/`status` and strips `terminalId`, so after dispatch we read the post-normalization layout back from the store and arm terminal restore via `addTerminalRestoreRequestId(...)` for every terminal leaf carrying a `sessionRef` (the `App.tsx:1069` / `terminal-restore.ts` pattern) so the create goes out as a restore. Panes the inventory marks `live: true` carry no `sessionRef` after Task 4's strip, so they are recreated fresh and never armed (see D7). Terminal panes get the D4 treatment; non-terminal kinds (`browser`, `editor`, `fresh-agent`, `extension`, `picker`) are recreated by passing the snapshot pane payload through as content (`{kind, ...payload}`) with a minimal per-kind adapter (Task 4/A10: `editor` gains the required `content: ''` default per D6; `fresh-agent` drops `restoreError` so normalize keeps the sessionRef) — the same normalize/strip path handles them, exactly as it does for `reopenClosedTab`. The auto-created empty shell tab from `App.tsx:1423` is left in place (deliberate: removing it would touch tab-lifecycle code other lanes own; it is one empty shell tab).

**D6 — Snapshot records have no split geometry** (flat `panes[]` per tab record), so recreation builds a right-leaning binary split chain (`direction: 'horizontal'`, `sizes: [50, 50]`) — panes come back, geometry is a default. This is what the store contains; not a deferral. Likewise a data fact: snapshots never capture editor buffer content (scratch-pad text is not persisted), while `EditorPaneContent.content` is a required field client-side (`paneTypes.ts:116-130`) — recovered editor panes therefore come back with an empty buffer (Task 4 supplies the required `content: ''` default).

**D7 — Live sessions are surfaced, not resumed.** The inventory joins terminal-registry liveness (read-only): every response pane carries `live: true|false` (true iff its effective `(provider, sessionId)` is owned by a currently-Running terminal), and `ledgerOnly` excludes live rows. Panes with `live: true` are recreated WITHOUT resume — `build-recovery-plan` strips their `sessionRef`, they are never armed for terminal restore, and the offer panel notes that sessions still running on the server were left untouched; layout/cwd/mode are still recreated. Attach-to-live was considered and REJECTED: the attach path from a fresh browser is unverified and collides with Lane B1's attach-gate/reconcile ownership. Why this matters: the direct wire-`sessionRef` rung (`terminal.rs:1074-1078`) bypasses the ladder that holds every existing live-guard (`terminal.rs:1690-1745`), so a create carrying a live session's ref would silently spawn a duplicate `claude --resume S` while the original live PTY owns S — the repo's own corruption doctrine (`terminal.rs:1671-1674` "silently wrong"; `:933` one-JSONL-writer). The server-side liveness guard on that direct rung (Task 2b) is defense-in-depth: it closes the inventory-fetch→accept race that client-side stripping alone cannot.

**Known limitation — freshopencode recovers fresh.** ~~Recovered `freshopencode` panes start FRESH: `opencode_ws.rs` `handle_create` never reads `resume_session_id` — a pre-existing bug shared with `reopenClosedTab`, and `crates/freshell-freshagent` is Lane B4's fenced crate, so this lane cannot fix it.~~ **RESOLVED at wave-B integration:** Lane B4 rewrote the opencode resume path — `handle_create` now rebinds a durable `ses_*` id from `resumeSessionId`/`sessionRef` (`opencode_ws.rs` resume_target → `handle_create_resume`; pinned by `create_with_resume_session_id_rebinds_the_durable_session`). The `sessionRef` passthrough this lane kept (forward-compatible by design) means recovered `freshopencode` panes now RESUME. Claude and codex fresh-agent resume were already verified working (`claude.rs:224`, `codex.rs:369-391`).

## Global Constraints

- Worktree: `/home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/recover-my-panes`, branch `feat/recover-my-panes`, base `origin/main@2dfbba58`. All commands below run from the worktree root.
- Rust: `cargo fmt --all` clean; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` green (required CI); `cargo test --workspace` green.
- Client: `npm run lint` green (jsx-a11y is a CI requirement); coordinated suites via `env -u FRESHELL_BIND_HOST npm test` (waits on the shared coordinator gate — WAIT if held, never kill a foreign holder; set `FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY="recover-my-panes lane B3"`); focused runs via `npm run test:vitest -- run <paths> [--config config/vitest/vitest.server.config.ts where noted]`.
- E2E: own `RustServer` instances on `findFreePort()` ephemeral ports — NEVER 3001/3002. Never restart the user's self-hosted server; never use broad kill patterns. ~78 GB disk — halt on ENOSPC.
- SCOPE FENCE — do NOT touch: `src/lib/ws-client.ts`; `App.tsx` regions 811-898, 900-981, 1002-1090, 1283-1325 (Lane B1); `crates/*/src/**/reconcile*` (B1); codex_candidate/locator (B2); `crates/freshell-freshagent/` (B4); the `tabs_persist.rs` WRITE path (read-only consumption is fine). No kimi/gemini work.
- Node test files use ESM: relative imports include `.js` extensions.
- PR policy: push the branch, STOP before `gh pr create`. Final report must state the kata h9vt disposition (Option A, restore endpoint + marker/fence deleted).

### Task 1: Server — pure inventory builder

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/freshell-server/src/recovery_inventory.rs`
- Create: `crates/freshell-server/src/recovery_inventory_tests.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` (add `mod recovery_inventory;` only)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/Cargo.toml` (only if `sha2`/hex aren't already dependencies — needed by `digest16`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `freshell_ws::pane_ledger::BindingRow` (fields serialize camelCase: `provider`, `sessionId`, `mode`, `cwd`, `state: bound|retired`, `retiredReason?: superseded|closed|gc_expired`, `supersededBy?: {provider, sessionId}`, `updatedAt`). Snapshot union doc shape (from `tabs_persist.rs`): `{deviceId, deviceLabel, capturedAt, records: [{tabKey, tabId, tabName, revision, updatedAt, paneCount, panes: [{paneId, kind, payload: {mode?, shell?, initialCwd?, sessionRef?: {provider, sessionId}, createRequestId?, ...}}]}]}`.
- Produces: `pub struct DeviceUnion { pub device_id: String, pub union_doc: serde_json::Value }`, `pub fn select_foreign_recent_generation_ids(generations: &[serde_json::Value], exclude_client: &str, boot_cutoff_ms: u64) -> Vec<String>` (the A15 staleness + A16 concurrent-client filter, consumed by Task 2), and `pub fn build_inventory(device_unions: Vec<DeviceUnion>, bindings: Vec<BindingRow>, live_session_keys: HashSet<(String, String)>) -> serde_json::Value` — the third input is the set of `(provider, sessionId)` pairs owned by a currently-Running terminal (Task 2 feeds it from the terminal registry, read-only) — returning:

```json
{
  "recoverable": true,
  "contentId": "9f3a1c2e00112233",
  "device": {
    "deviceId": "dev1", "deviceLabel": "Dan's laptop", "capturedAt": 1000,
    "tabs": [
      { "tabKey": "k1", "tabName": "work",
        "panes": [
          { "paneId": "p1", "kind": "terminal", "mode": "claude", "shell": null,
            "cwd": "/home/dan/proj", "payload": { "...": "verbatim snapshot payload" },
            "sessionRef": { "provider": "claude", "sessionId": "S2" },
            "ledgerState": "bound", "live": false }
        ] }
    ]
  },
  "otherDevices": [ { "deviceId": "dev0", "deviceLabel": "old", "capturedAt": 500, "paneCount": 3 } ],
  "ledgerOnly": [ { "provider": "codex", "sessionId": "C9", "mode": "codex", "cwd": "/x" } ]
}
```

Rules encoded:
- `device` = the union with the greatest `capturedAt` that has ≥1 record.
- Every pane's `sessionRef` in the response is the **effective** ref per Design Decision D4 (`ledgerState` ∈ `bound|closed|gc_expired|unknown`; `closed` ⇒ `sessionRef: null`).
- Every pane carries `"live": true|false` — true iff its effective `(provider, sessionId)` ∈ `live_session_keys` (D7).
- `ledgerOnly` = `state == bound` rows whose `(provider, sessionId)` matches no effective pane ref in ANY device union (not just the primary — a two-device steady state must not report the other device's sessions as orphaned) AND that is not in the live set (D7).
- `contentId` = sha256 truncated to 16 hex chars (reuse the repo's digest convention — `digest_value`/`snapshot_content_id`, `tabs_persist.rs:70-87`) over the TIMESTAMP-FREE canonical substance: the sorted list of `(deviceId, tabKey, paneId, kind, effective provider:sessionId or "-")` for every pane in every included device union, plus sorted `provider:sessionId` for the `ledgerOnly` rows. `capturedAt`/`updatedAt` are EXCLUDED by design: the server heartbeat re-pushes stamp a new `capturedAt` every ≤5 min with any second connected client, and that churn must not defeat dismissal (D3).
- `recoverable` = primary device exists OR `ledgerOnly` non-empty. Empty input ⇒ `{"recoverable": false, "contentId": "...", "device": null, "otherDevices": [], "ledgerOnly": []}`.
- `select_foreign_recent_generation_ids` (A15 staleness + A16 concurrent-client rules, applied by Task 2 when composing each device's union): drop the requester's own generations; drop every client ALL of whose retained generations have `capturedAt >= boot_cutoff_ms` (A16, D2 — a client born after this browser session booted is a concurrently-opened fresh window, never lost data; a real lost client's generations all predate the fresh boot); then drop every client whose newest generation `capturedAt` is more than 15 minutes older than that device's max `capturedAt` **computed over the remaining clients** (junk must never stale-out real recovery data). Rationale: every connected window force-pushes a heartbeat at least every 5 min (`tabRegistrySync.ts:21, 475-477`), so any client silent for >15 min is closed or rotated; this suppresses resurrection of closed tabs via the purely-additive union (closed tabs leave no durable trace — only open records are persisted). Post-filtering generations here leaves the `tabs_persist` write path untouched.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `crates/freshell-server/src/recovery_inventory_tests.rs`. Use the sibling-module house convention. Construct `BindingRow` values directly (import from `freshell_ws::pane_ledger`; use its real field/enum names — open that file to copy them; e.g. if state is an enum use `BindingState::Bound`). Test bodies:

```rust
use super::*;
use serde_json::json;
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn no_live() -> HashSet<(String, String)> {
    HashSet::new()
}

fn live(pairs: &[(&str, &str)]) -> HashSet<(String, String)> {
    pairs.iter().map(|(p, s)| (p.to_string(), s.to_string())).collect()
}

Write small local helpers `binding_row(provider, session_id, state_parts)`, `binding_row_at(provider, session_id, state_parts, updated_at)` (same, with a settable `updatedAt` — the timestamp-churn test needs it), `bound()`, `retired_closed()`, `retired_gc_expired()`, `retired_superseded_by(p, s)` that construct real `BindingRow` values (copy field names/enums from `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs:93`; fill required timestamps with constants like `1000`).

Create `crates/freshell-server/src/recovery_inventory.rs` containing ONLY the types + an `unimplemented!()`-free stub that compiles but returns `json!(null)`, plus the test include:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
#[path = "recovery_inventory_tests.rs"]
mod tests;
```

Add `mod recovery_inventory;` to `main.rs` (mirror how `mod tabs_snapshots;` is declared).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-server recovery_inventory -- --nocapture`
Expected: FAIL — assertions fail against the `null` stub (compilation must succeed; assertion failure is the red).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `build_inventory`**

The `row_*` accessor helpers (`row_provider`, `row_session_id`, `row_is_bound`, `row_reason_is_closed`, `row_successor`, `row_mode`, `row_cwd`) are thin one-line wrappers over the actual `BindingRow` fields/enums — write them against the real definitions in `pane_ledger.rs:93` (they exist so this module compiles against whatever the exact enum spellings are; each is a single field access, not logic).

`digest16(parts: &[String]) -> String` is the contentId digest: sha256 over the parts joined with `\u{1}`, hex-encoded, truncated to 16 chars. Reuse the repo's digest convention — copy the shape of `digest_value`/`snapshot_content_id` from `crates/freshell-ws/src/tabs_persist.rs:70-87` and its `sha2`/hex approach (add the dependency to `freshell-server`'s `Cargo.toml` if it isn't already there).

### Task 2: Server — `GET /api/recovery/inventory` route

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/recovery_inventory.rs` (add state/router/handler)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/recovery_inventory_tests.rs` (add route tests)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` (one `.merge(...)` in the router assembly at ~`main.rs:759+`)
- Modify (only if needed): the terminal registry in `crates/freshell-terminal/` — a read-only row-listing accessor for the liveness join, if none is public today (no behavior change)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `freshell_ws::tabs_persist::{list_snapshot_devices, read_device_overview, read_generations_union_by_ids}` (sync `io::Result`, must run in `spawn_blocking`); `freshell_ws::pane_ledger::PaneLedger::list_bindings()` (sync, memory-only, callable directly); the shared terminal-registry handle (read-only — the same instance the WS server state receives; copy the exact type + binding name from `main.rs`) for the liveness join; `select_foreign_recent_generation_ids` and `build_inventory` from Task 1; the per-handler auth helper used by `tabs_snapshots.rs` handlers (`is_authed(&headers, &state.auth_token)` — copy the exact import from that file).
- Produces: `pub struct RecoveryInventoryState { pub auth_token: String, pub snapshots_dir: Option<std::path::PathBuf>, pub ledger: std::sync::Arc<freshell_ws::pane_ledger::PaneLedger>, pub registry: /* shared terminal-registry handle, same type main.rs wires into the WS state */ }` (`#[derive(Clone)]`) and `pub fn router(state: RecoveryInventoryState) -> axum::Router`. Route: `GET /api/recovery/inventory?clientInstanceId=<id>&bootAgoMs=<elapsed-ms>` (`bootAgoMs` optional; missing ⇒ `0`, i.e. `boot_cutoff = now` and the A16 concurrent-client filter drops nothing that predates the request; a non-numeric value is rejected by the `Query` extractor with 400 — the client always sends `Math.max(0, Math.round(...))`).

Handler behavior: 401 without valid token (same check as every other handler); with `snapshots_dir: None` or missing dir → inventory built from ledger only; parse `bootAgoMs` from the query (`Option<u64>` on `InventoryQuery`; missing ⇒ 0) and compute `let boot_cutoff = now_ms().saturating_sub(boot_ago_ms);` (same `now_ms` helper convention as `tabs_persist.rs`); snapshot reads: `spawn_blocking` over `(dir, exclude_client, boot_cutoff)` doing — `list_snapshot_devices(&dir)` → for each device `read_device_overview(&dir, &device)` → select generation ids via `select_foreign_recent_generation_ids(&generations, &exclude_client, boot_cutoff)` (Task 1 — drops the requester's own generations, concurrent post-boot clients per the A16 rule, AND stale clients per the A15 recency rule) → `read_generations_union_by_ids(&dir, &device, &ids)` → collect `DeviceUnion`. Devices with zero surviving generations are skipped. IO errors and `JoinError` → 500 + `tracing::error!` (fail-loud, three-arm match, same shape as the dryRun path at `tabs_snapshots.rs:330`). Then build the live set from the registry (read-only): `live_session_keys(&state.registry)` collects `(provider = mode, sessionId)` for every currently-Running terminal row — the same row fields the ladder's A13 guard reads at `terminal.rs:1690-1745`; if the registry lacks a public row-listing accessor, add a read-only one to `freshell-terminal` (no behavior change). Finally `build_inventory(unions, state.ledger.list_bindings(), live)` → `Json(...)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing route tests**

Append to `recovery_inventory_tests.rs` (reuse the `oneshot` helper pattern from `tabs_snapshots_tests.rs:79` — a `async fn get(router, uri, auth) -> (StatusCode, Value)` helper using `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot`). Snapshot fixture files are written directly with the store's real layout — `<dir>/<device>/<client>-<capturedAt:020>-r<rev:012>.json` (alphanumeric device/client ids need no escaping):

```rust
fn write_snapshot(dir: &std::path::Path, device: &str, client: &str, captured_at: u64, rev: u64, records: serde_json::Value) {
    let doc = json!({
        "deviceId": device, "deviceLabel": format!("label-{device}"), "clientInstanceId": client,
        "serverInstanceId": "srv-test", "snapshotRevision": rev, "capturedAt": captured_at,
        "records": records
    });
    let d = dir.join(device);
    std::fs::create_dir_all(&d).unwrap();
    std::fs::write(d.join(format!("{client}-{captured_at:020}-r{rev:012}.json")),

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-server recovery_inventory`
Expected: FAIL to compile on missing `router`/`RecoveryInventoryState` — add compiling stubs (handler returns 500) — then FAIL on assertions.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement state, router, handler**

    // D2/A16: anchor the concurrent-client filter to the requester's boot. Missing param
    // => 0 => boot_cutoff = now, so nothing that predates the request is dropped.
    // now_ms(): same epoch-millis helper convention tabs_persist.rs uses - import or replicate.
    let boot_cutoff = now_ms().saturating_sub(q.boot_ago_ms.unwrap_or(0));
    let unions = match state.snapshots_dir.clone() {
        None => vec![],
        Some(dir) => {
            let job = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || read_foreign_unions(&dir, &exclude, boot_cutoff));
            match job.await {
                Ok(Ok(u)) => u,
                Ok(Err(e)) => { tracing::error!(error = %e, "recovery inventory snapshot read failed"); return internal_error(); }
                Err(e) => { tracing::error!(error = %e, "recovery inventory join failed"); return internal_error(); }

/// Read-only liveness join (D7): (provider = mode, sessionId) for every currently-Running

fn live_session_keys(registry: &/* registry handle type */) -> std::collections::HashSet<(String, String)> {

            Err(e) => return Err(e),
        }
    }
    Ok(out)
}
```

Notes for the implementer: `unauthorized()`/`internal_error()`/`is_authed` — import or replicate exactly what `tabs_snapshots.rs` handlers use (auth check is the first statement, constant-time compare, `x-auth-token` header then cookie). `read_generations_union_by_ids` returns a `ComponentsUnion` — `union_value(...)` is whatever accessor yields the union `Value` (see how the restore endpoint consumes it); if `Missing` is a variant, treat as skip-device. If the overview generation entries name the id field differently (e.g. `id`), match the actual field — the Step 1 tests, driven by real files, are the arbiter.

Wire in `main.rs` next to the existing `tabs_snapshots` merge (~`:783-795`):

```rust
.merge(recovery_inventory::router(recovery_inventory::RecoveryInventoryState {
    auth_token: auth_token.clone(),
    snapshots_dir: tabs_snapshots_dir.clone(),          // same value the tabs_snapshots state receives
    ledger: std::sync::Arc::clone(&pane_ledger),        // created at main.rs:426
    registry: /* clone of the shared terminal-registry handle the WS state receives */,
}))
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-server recovery_inventory`
Expected: PASS (all route + builder tests).

- [ ] **Step 5: Full crate check, commit**

```bash
cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test -p freshell-server
git add -A crates/freshell-server/src
git commit -m "feat(server): GET /api/recovery/inventory - device-scoped recoverable-state read API (B3/P1.9)"

### Task 2b: Server — liveness guard on the direct wire-sessionRef rung (defense-in-depth for D7)

> Inserted after Task 2 during load-bearing-assumption validation (A2). Later tasks keep
> their original numbers — all existing cross-references remain valid.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs` (`handle_create` — the direct wire-`sessionRef` rung at `:1047`, `:1074-1078`; NOT the fenced reconcile modules)
- Create: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/live_session_ref_guard.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the ladder's A13 guard semantics as the model (`terminal.rs:1690-1745`: rung-1 Running-row check, identity-registry owner check `:1717-1727`, REST-shaped registry-row check `:1728-1745`); the `RestoreUnavailable` error-frame shape (`terminal.rs:1104-1117`); the integration-test harness patterns of `crates/freshell-ws/tests/claude_restore_unavailable.rs` and `tests/pane_ledger_restore.rs`.
- Produces: `terminal.create` with `restore: true` + a wire `sessionRef` whose `(provider, sessionId)` is already owned by a currently-Running terminal is REFUSED with a loud `RestoreUnavailable`-style error frame — never a second spawn.

Why this task exists: every existing live-guard lives inside the `createRequestId`-keyed ladder, and the direct rung (`:1074-1078`) bypasses the ladder entirely (`:1099-1101` runs only when `resume_session_id` is still `None`). The D5 recreation path always sends a wire `sessionRef` with a re-minted `createRequestId`, so without this guard a session that goes live between the inventory fetch and the user's accept would silently spawn a duplicate `claude --resume S` while the original live PTY owns S — the repo's own corruption doctrine (`terminal.rs:1671-1674` "silently wrong"; `:933` one-JSONL-writer). Client-side live handling (Tasks 4/5) prevents the common case; this guard closes the fetch→accept race (D7).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing integration test**

Create `crates/freshell-ws/tests/live_session_ref_guard.rs`, mirroring the harness of `claude_restore_unavailable.rs` / `pane_ledger_restore.rs` (same server bootstrap, same WS client helpers, same fake-CLI arrangement those tests use). Body:
1. Create a claude terminal the way those tests do and let it reach Running, owning session `S` (read `S` back the way `pane_ledger_restore.rs` does).
2. Send `terminal.create { restore: true, sessionRef: { provider: "claude", sessionId: S }, requestId: <fresh nanoid-style id> }` — the exact wire shape the D5 recovery path produces.
3. Assert: an error frame comes back (`RestoreUnavailable`-style code, message naming the live session), NO `terminal.created` for the request, and the registry still holds exactly ONE terminal owning `S` (no duplicate spawn).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test to verify it fails**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test live_session_ref_guard`
Expected: FAIL — today the create succeeds and spawns a duplicate (the falsified A2 behavior).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the guard**

In `handle_create`, after `resume_session_id` derivation (`:1074-1096`) and before any spawn work: when `resume_session_id` was derived from the wire `sessionRef`, check whether a currently-Running terminal already owns `(provider = mode, resume_session_id)` — mirror the exact row-matching the ladder's A13 guard performs (`:1728-1745`, plus the claude identity-registry check `:1717-1727`). If live, send the `RestoreUnavailable`-style error frame (same shape as `:1104-1117`, message e.g. "Session is still running on the server.") and abort the create. Mode-generic (claude/codex/opencode/amplifier), matching the direct rung's scope — codex/opencode have no live-guard on ANY path today, so this closes their gap too.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the full guard + restore test set**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test live_session_ref_guard --test claude_restore_unavailable --test pane_ledger_restore --test codex_session_ref_resume`
Expected: PASS — the new refusal plus all 9 existing tests stay green (after a server restart the old terminal is not Running, so post-restart recovery resumes are unaffected).

- [ ] **Step 5: Format, lint, commit**

```bash
cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy -p freshell-ws --all-targets -- -D warnings
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs crates/freshell-ws/tests/live_session_ref_guard.rs
git commit -m "feat(ws): refuse sessionRef restore while a Running terminal owns the session (B3/P1.9, D7 guard)"
```

### Task 3: Client — boot eligibility + dismissal persistence

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/recovery/boot-state.ts`
- Create: `src/lib/recovery/dismissal.ts`
- Modify: `src/main.tsx` (comment only — pin the import-order invariant on the existing `import '@/store/storage-migration'` line (currently `main.tsx:4`, after the react/react-dom/react-redux library imports); no code change)
- Create: `test/unit/client/lib/recovery/boot-state.test.ts`
- Create: `test/unit/client/lib/recovery/dismissal.test.ts`
- Create: `test/unit/client/lib/recovery/main-import-order.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `window.localStorage` (jsdom provides it in tests; clear it yourself — `console.error` throws in `afterEach`).
- Produces:
  - `boot-state.ts`: `export function computeHadPersistedLayout(storage: Pick<Storage, 'getItem'>): boolean`, `export const hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot: boolean`, and `export const bootCapturedAtMs: number` (both constants evaluated at module import; `bootCapturedAtMs = Date.now()` — the anchor for D2's `bootAgoMs`).
  - `dismissal.ts`: `export function isDismissed(contentId: string): boolean`, `export function recordDismissal(contentId: string): void` (cap 20, newest kept), `export interface PendingOffer { contentId: string; bootAt: number }`, `export function getPendingOffer(): PendingOffer | null`, `export function setPendingOffer(contentId: string, bootAt: number): void`, `export function clearPendingOffer(): void`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`test/unit/client/lib/recovery/boot-state.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest'
import { computeHadPersistedLayout } from '@/lib/recovery/boot-state'

const store = (entries: Record<string, string>) => ({ getItem: (k: string) => entries[k] ?? null })

describe('computeHadPersistedLayout', () => {
  beforeEach(() => localStorage.clear())

  it('empty-never: no layout keys at all -> false (offer-eligible)', () => {
    expect(computeHadPersistedLayout(store({}))).toBe(false)
  })

  it('empty-cleared: only unrelated keys survive a clear -> false (offer-eligible)', () => {
    expect(computeHadPersistedLayout(store({ 'freshell.device-id.v2': 'dev' }))).toBe(false)
  })

  it('populated: layout key present -> true (no offer)', () => {
    expect(computeHadPersistedLayout(store({ 'freshell.layout.v3': '{"tabs":[{"id":"t1"}]}' }))).toBe(true)
  })

  it('deliberately emptied: layout key present with zero tabs -> true (no offer)', () => {
    expect(computeHadPersistedLayout(store({ 'freshell.layout.v3': '{"tabs":[]}' }))).toBe(true)
  })

  it('backup key alone counts as persisted layout', () => {
    expect(computeHadPersistedLayout(store({ 'freshell.layout.v3.bak': '{}' }))).toBe(true)
  })
})

describe('hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot capture', () => {
  it('is captured at module import time, before later writes', async () => {
    localStorage.clear()
    const { hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot } = await import('@/lib/recovery/boot-state?fresh=' + Date.now())
    localStorage.setItem('freshell.layout.v3', '{"tabs":[{"id":"auto"}]}') // simulates auto-tab persist
    expect(hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot).toBe(false)
  })
})
```

`test/unit/client/lib/recovery/main-import-order.test.ts` — pins the two D1/A8 ordering invariants (cheap source-text assertions; synchronous module-load migration writers exist, so ordering is load-bearing):

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'

describe('boot-state capture ordering invariants (D1/A8)', () => {
  const src = readFileSync('src/main.tsx', 'utf8')

  it('storage-migration is imported before the store and App in main.tsx', () => {
    // It re-materializes freshell.layout.v3 from the
    // `.backup-before-fresh-agent-centralization` key BEFORE any capture can run —
    // which is why boot-state checks only v3 + .bak. The imports above it
    // (react, react-dom/client, react-redux) are pure library imports with no
    // localStorage side effects, so "before store/App" is the real invariant.
    const migrationIdx = src.indexOf("import '@/store/storage-migration'")
    const storeIdx = src.indexOf("from '@/store/store'")
    const appIdx = src.indexOf("from '@/App'")
    expect(migrationIdx).toBeGreaterThan(-1)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `npm run test:vitest -- run test/unit/client/lib/recovery/`
Expected: FAIL — modules don't exist ("Failed to resolve import").

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement both modules**

`src/lib/recovery/boot-state.ts`:

```ts
const LAYOUT_KEY = 'freshell.layout.v3'
const LAYOUT_BAK_KEY = 'freshell.layout.v3.bak'

export function computeHadPersistedLayout(storage: Pick<Storage, 'getItem'>): boolean {
  return storage.getItem(LAYOUT_KEY) !== null || storage.getItem(LAYOUT_BAK_KEY) !== null
}

// Captured at module import. Synchronous module-load writers of freshell.layout.v3 DO
// exist (storage-migration.ts:332/431 — self-executing via main.tsx's side-effect import
// at main.tsx:4 — and migrateV2ToV3, persistedState.ts:594, during tabsSlice module eval),
// but each fires only when durable layout data ALREADY existed, so key-presence here
// remains the correct "had layout" signal. storage-migration also re-materializes
// freshell.layout.v3 from the `.backup-before-fresh-agent-centralization` key BEFORE this
// module can load — which is why we check only v3 + .bak. Invariants (pinned by
// main-import-order.test.ts): the storage-migration import stays ahead of the store/App
// imports in main.tsx (the imports above it are side-effect-free library imports);
// main.tsx never imports this module.
// The asynchronous writers (auto shell tab App.tsx:1423-1427, 500ms persist debounce)
// land long after module eval (see docs/plans/2026-07-26-recover-my-panes.md D1).
export const hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot: boolean =
  typeof window !== 'undefined' && computeHadPersistedLayout(window.localStorage)

// Paired with the capture above: the moment this boot's "had layout" signal was taken.
// Anchor for the inventory request's bootAgoMs (D2's concurrent-client filter) - sent as
// an elapsed DURATION so client/server clock skew cannot corrupt the server-side cutoff.
export const bootCapturedAtMs: number = Date.now()
```

In `src/main.tsx`, add a comment on the existing `import '@/store/storage-migration'` line (no code change):

```ts
// MUST stay ahead of the store/App imports: recover-my-panes boot-state (D1) depends on
// migrations having re-materialized freshell.layout.v3 BEFORE any capture runs (the
// react/react-dom/react-redux imports above are side-effect-free) — see
// docs/plans/2026-07-26-recover-my-panes.md and main-import-order.test.ts.
```

`src/lib/recovery/dismissal.ts` (same pattern as `src/lib/setup-wizard-dismissal.ts`):

```ts
const DISMISSED_KEY = 'freshell.recovery.dismissed.v1'
const PENDING_KEY = 'freshell.recovery.pending.v1'
const CAP = 20

function readDismissed(): string[] {
  try {
    const raw = localStorage.getItem(DISMISSED_KEY)
    const parsed = raw ? JSON.parse(raw) : []
    return Array.isArray(parsed) ? parsed.filter((x) => typeof x === 'string') : []
  } catch {
    return []
  }
}

export function isDismissed(contentId: string): boolean {
  return readDismissed().includes(contentId)
}

export function recordDismissal(contentId: string): void {
  const next = [...readDismissed().filter((id) => id !== contentId), contentId].slice(-CAP)
  localStorage.setItem(DISMISSED_KEY, JSON.stringify(next))
}

export interface PendingOffer { contentId: string; bootAt: number }

export function getPendingOffer(): PendingOffer | null {
  try {
    const raw = localStorage.getItem(PENDING_KEY)
    if (!raw) return null
    const parsed: unknown = JSON.parse(raw)
    const p = parsed as { contentId?: unknown; bootAt?: unknown }
    return typeof p?.contentId === 'string' && typeof p?.bootAt === 'number'
      ? { contentId: p.contentId, bootAt: p.bootAt }
      : null
  } catch {
    return null
  }
}

export function setPendingOffer(contentId: string, bootAt: number): void {
  localStorage.setItem(PENDING_KEY, JSON.stringify({ contentId, bootAt }))
}

export function clearPendingOffer(): void {
  localStorage.removeItem(PENDING_KEY)
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `npm run test:vitest -- run test/unit/client/lib/recovery/`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash

### Task 4: Client — inventory types, API helper, recovery-plan builder (authority chain)

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/recovery/types.ts`
- Create: `src/lib/recovery/build-recovery-plan.ts`
- Modify: `src/lib/api.ts` (add `getRecoveryInventory` next to `getBootstrap` at `api.ts:287-289`)
- Create: `test/unit/client/lib/recovery/build-recovery-plan.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `PaneNode` / `TerminalPaneContent` from `@/store/paneTypes` (`PaneNode = leaf{id, content} | split{id, direction, children:[PaneNode,PaneNode], sizes:[number,number]}`, `paneTypes.ts:274-276`; terminal content fields incl. `initialCwd`, `sessionRef: {provider, sessionId}`, non-optional `createRequestId`/`status`); `nanoid`; `api.get` + `buildQueryString(entries: Array<[string, string | number | undefined]>)` (`api.ts:273-285` — it takes an ARRAY OF `[key, value]` TUPLES, not an object; passing an object fails typecheck and would throw at runtime iterating a non-iterable).
- Produces:
  - `types.ts`: `RecoveryInventory`, `RecoveryPane` (`{paneId, kind, mode: string|null, shell: string|null, cwd: string|null, payload: Record<string, unknown>, sessionRef: {provider, sessionId}|null, ledgerState: 'bound'|'closed'|'gc_expired'|'unknown', live: boolean}`), `RecoveryTab`, `LedgerOnlyEntry` — mirroring Task 1's response shape.
  - `api.ts`: `export async function getRecoveryInventory(clientInstanceId: string, bootAgoMs: number): Promise<RecoveryInventory>` → `api.get<RecoveryInventory>('/api/recovery/inventory' + buildQueryString([['clientInstanceId', clientInstanceId], ['bootAgoMs', Math.max(0, Math.round(bootAgoMs))]]))` (tuple-entries call shape — see Consumes; `bootAgoMs` feeds D2's server-side concurrent-client cutoff).
  - `build-recovery-plan.ts`:

```ts
export interface RecoveryTabPlan { tabId: string; title: string; layout: PaneNode; paneTitles: Record<string, string> }
export function countRecoverablePanes(inv: RecoveryInventory): number
export function buildRecoveryPlan(inv: RecoveryInventory): RecoveryTabPlan[]
```

Rules: one `RecoveryTabPlan` per inventory tab (tabId = `nanoid()`); pane list → right-leaning binary split chain (`direction: 'horizontal'`, `sizes: [50, 50]`); terminal leaf content `{kind:'terminal', createRequestId: nanoid(), status: 'creating', mode, shell, initialCwd: cwd, sessionRef: sessionRef ?? undefined}` (fields with `null` inventory values omitted; `restoreLayout` re-mints ids/status — that's expected), and panes with `live: true` get their `sessionRef` STRIPPED (recreated without resume, D7 — layout/cwd/mode still carried, and with no `sessionRef` they are never armed for terminal restore); non-terminal kinds go through a small per-kind adapter (A10): `editor` panes supply the required `content: ''` default (`EditorPaneContent.content` is required by `paneTypes.ts:116-130` but absent from snapshot payloads — buffer text is never captured, D6); `fresh-agent` panes strip `restoreError` before passthrough (normalize's `existingRestoreError` branch would drop `sessionRef`; normalize re-validates canonical claude refs itself); all other kinds (`browser`, `extension`, `picker`) = `{...payload, kind}` passthrough (the `reopenClosedTab` restore path normalizes it); `ledgerOnly` entries, if any, become one extra final tab titled `Recovered sessions` whose panes are terminal content with `mode: entry.mode`, `initialCwd: entry.cwd ?? undefined`, `sessionRef: {provider, sessionId}` (live rows never reach the client — the server excludes them). `countRecoverablePanes` = device panes + ledgerOnly length.

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `npm run test:vitest -- run test/unit/client/lib/recovery/build-recovery-plan.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — module missing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement types + builder + api helper**

`src/lib/recovery/types.ts` per the Interfaces block above. `src/lib/recovery/build-recovery-plan.ts`:

```ts
import { nanoid } from 'nanoid'
import type { PaneNode, PaneContent } from '@/store/paneTypes'
import type { RecoveryInventory, RecoveryPane, LedgerOnlyEntry } from './types'

function terminalContent(p: { mode: string | null; shell: string | null; cwd: string | null; sessionRef: { provider: string; sessionId: string } | null; live: boolean }): PaneContent {
  return {
    kind: 'terminal',
    createRequestId: nanoid(), // re-minted by restoreLayout normalization; required by the type
    status: 'creating',
    ...(p.mode ? { mode: p.mode } : {}),
    ...(p.shell ? { shell: p.shell } : {}),
    ...(p.cwd ? { initialCwd: p.cwd } : {}),
    // D7: live sessions are left untouched - recreate the pane WITHOUT resume
    ...(p.sessionRef && !p.live ? { sessionRef: p.sessionRef } : {}),
  } as PaneContent
}

function paneContent(p: RecoveryPane): PaneContent {
  if (p.kind === 'terminal') return terminalContent(p)
  if (p.kind === 'editor') {
    // EditorPaneContent.content is required (paneTypes.ts:116-130) but snapshots never
    // capture buffer text - recreate with an empty buffer (data fact, D6)
    return { content: '', ...p.payload, kind: 'editor' } as PaneContent
  }
  if (p.kind === 'fresh-agent') {
    // normalize's existingRestoreError branch would drop sessionRef; strip restoreError
    // and let normalize re-validate the ref itself (A10)
    const { restoreError: _restoreError, ...payload } = p.payload
    return { ...payload, kind: 'fresh-agent' } as PaneContent
  }
  return { ...p.payload, kind: p.kind } as PaneContent
}

function leaf(content: PaneContent): PaneNode {
  return { type: 'leaf', id: nanoid(), content } as PaneNode
}

function chain(leaves: PaneNode[]): PaneNode {
  if (leaves.length === 1) return leaves[0]
  const [head, ...rest] = leaves
  return { type: 'split', id: nanoid(), direction: 'horizontal', children: [head, chain(rest)], sizes: [50, 50] } as PaneNode
}

export interface RecoveryTabPlan { tabId: string; title: string; layout: PaneNode; paneTitles: Record<string, string> }

export function countRecoverablePanes(inv: RecoveryInventory): number {
  const device = inv.device?.tabs.reduce((n, t) => n + t.panes.length, 0) ?? 0
  return device + inv.ledgerOnly.length
}

export function buildRecoveryPlan(inv: RecoveryInventory): RecoveryTabPlan[] {
  const plans: RecoveryTabPlan[] = (inv.device?.tabs ?? [])
    .filter((t) => t.panes.length > 0)
    .map((t) => ({ tabId: nanoid(), title: t.tabName || 'Recovered', layout: chain(t.panes.map((p) => leaf(paneContent(p)))), paneTitles: {} }))
  if (inv.ledgerOnly.length > 0) {
    plans.push({
      tabId: nanoid(),
      title: 'Recovered sessions',
      layout: chain(inv.ledgerOnly.map((e: LedgerOnlyEntry) =>
        leaf(terminalContent({ mode: e.mode, shell: null, cwd: e.cwd, sessionRef: { provider: e.provider, sessionId: e.sessionId }, live: false })))),
      paneTitles: {},
    })
  }
  return plans
}
```

In `src/lib/api.ts`, next to `getBootstrap`:

```ts
export async function getRecoveryInventory(clientInstanceId: string, bootAgoMs: number): Promise<RecoveryInventory> {
  return api.get<RecoveryInventory>(
    `/api/recovery/inventory${buildQueryString([['clientInstanceId', clientInstanceId], ['bootAgoMs', Math.max(0, Math.round(bootAgoMs))]])}`,
  )
}
```

(Import the type; match `getBootstrap`'s exact call style including any options argument.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `npm run test:vitest -- run test/unit/client/lib/recovery/`
Expected: PASS. Also run `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` if a typecheck script isn't already part of `npm run check`; fix type mismatches against the real `paneTypes.ts` definitions (the casts above are the seam — prefer removing casts by matching the real types).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/lib/recovery/ src/lib/api.ts test/unit/client/lib/recovery/build-recovery-plan.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(client): recovery inventory types, API helper, and recovery-plan builder honoring the ledger authority chain (B3/P1.9)"
```

### Task 5: Client — RecoveryOfferPanel component (fetch, offer, accept, decline)

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/RecoveryOfferPanel.tsx`
- Modify: `src/store/tabRegistrySync.ts` (export the existing module-private clientInstanceId getter — a 2-line visibility change, e.g. `export function getClientInstanceId(): string` wrapping what the push envelope already uses; do not change its behavior)
- Create: `test/unit/client/components/RecoveryOfferPanel.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot` + `bootCapturedAtMs`, dismissal module (Task 3), `getRecoveryInventory` (Task 4), `buildRecoveryPlan`/`countRecoverablePanes` (Task 4), `addTab` (`tabsSlice.ts:274-290` — payload accepts `id`; `activeTabId` set unconditionally), `restoreLayout` (`panesSlice.ts:910-926` — no-ops if the tab already has a layout), `addTerminalRestoreRequestId` (`src/lib/terminal-restore.ts`), `getClientInstanceId`.
- Produces: `export function RecoveryOfferPanel(): JSX.Element | null` — fully self-gating (no props), rendered unconditionally from App. Also `export function armRecoveredTerminalRestores(state: RootState, tabIds: string[]): void` — walks each tab's post-normalization layout in `state.panes`, and for every terminal leaf whose content has a `sessionRef`, calls `addTerminalRestoreRequestId(content.createRequestId)`.

Behavior:
1. On mount: `const pending = getPendingOffer()`; if `(hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot && !pending)` → render null forever. Otherwise `const bootAt = pending?.bootAt ?? bootCapturedAtMs` and fetch `getRecoveryInventory(getClientInstanceId(), Date.now() - bootAt)` once (D2: `bootAgoMs` anchors the server's concurrent-client cutoff to the ORIGINAL pre-junk boot, also across pending re-offers); on error or `recoverable: false` or `isDismissed(contentId)` → render null; else `setPendingOffer(contentId, bootAt)` and show the panel.
2. Panel (modal-style, reuse the portal/overlay/focus pattern of `src/components/ui/confirm-modal.tsx`): heading `Restore N panes from server memory?` (N = `countRecoverablePanes`), the device label (`inventory.device.deviceLabel`, when a device is present), a list of recoverable items — for device panes: `{tabName}: {mode ?? kind}` plus cwd when present; for ledgerOnly: `{mode} session — {cwd ?? 'unknown directory'}`; buttons `Restore` and `Not now`. When any device pane has `live: true`, also render a note with `data-testid="recovery-live-note"` (copy flexible, e.g. `Some sessions are still running on the server — they were left untouched; their panes reopen without resuming.`) per D7.
3. Accept: `clearPendingOffer()`; for each `RecoveryTabPlan`: `dispatch(addTab({ id: plan.tabId, title: plan.title }))`, `dispatch(restoreLayout({ tabId: plan.tabId, layout: plan.layout, paneTitles: plan.paneTitles }))`; then `armRecoveredTerminalRestores(store.getState(), planTabIds)`; hide panel. (Live panes carry no `sessionRef` after Task 4's strip, so the walk never arms them — no component-level special-casing needed.)
4. Decline: `recordDismissal(contentId)`; `clearPendingOffer()`; hide panel. No further renders this or future visits for this contentId.
5. A11y: dialog has `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby` pointing at the heading id; list is a `<ul>`; both buttons are real `<button>` elements with visible text. `data-testid="recovery-offer-panel"`, `data-testid="recovery-accept"`, `data-testid="recovery-decline"` for e2e.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`test/unit/client/components/RecoveryOfferPanel.test.tsx` — per-test `configureStore` with the real `tabs` + `panes` reducers (import the same reducer wiring an existing store test uses); mock the api module:

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from 'vitest'
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'

  computeHadPersistedLayout: () => false,
  hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot: false, // simulate empty boot; per-test override via vi.mocked where needed
  bootCapturedAtMs: 0,
}))
vi.mock('@/store/tabRegistrySync', async (importOriginal) => ({

function makeTestStore() {
  return configureStore({ reducer: { tabs: tabsReducer, panes: panesReducer } })
}

const INVENTORY = {
  recoverable: true, contentId: 'cid-1',
  device: { deviceId: 'd', deviceLabel: 'l', capturedAt: 1, tabs: [{ tabKey: 'k', tabName: 'work', panes: [

```

Adjust the state-shape assertions in the accept test to the real `tabs`/`panes` slice shapes (assert: at least one new tab exists whose title is `work`, and the panes layout for it contains a terminal leaf with `sessionRef.sessionId === 'S2'`). Also add: (a) a test that `hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot: true` + no pending flag renders nothing and never fetches (use a second mock variant via `vi.doMock` + dynamic import, or split into a separate test file with a different boot-state mock — whichever matches house style); (b) a live-note test — render with an inventory whose pane has `live: true` and assert `recovery-live-note` is visible, and that after accept the recreated pane's content has NO `sessionRef` (D7).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `npm run test:vitest -- run test/unit/client/components/RecoveryOfferPanel.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL — component missing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the component**

Implement per the Behavior contract above. Structure:

```tsx
export function RecoveryOfferPanel() {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
  const store = useStore<RootState>()
  const [inventory, setInventory] = useState<RecoveryInventory | null>(null)
  const [resolved, setResolved] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    const pending = getPendingOffer()
    if (hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot && !pending) { setResolved(true); return }
    const bootAt = pending?.bootAt ?? bootCapturedAtMs
    let cancelled = false
    getRecoveryInventory(getClientInstanceId(), Date.now() - bootAt)
      .then((inv) => {
        if (cancelled) return
        if (!inv.recoverable || isDismissed(inv.contentId)) { setResolved(true); return }
        setPendingOffer(inv.contentId, bootAt)
        setInventory(inv)
      })
      .catch(() => { if (!cancelled) setResolved(true) })
    return () => { cancelled = true }
  }, [])

  const accept = () => {
    if (!inventory) return
    clearPendingOffer()
    const plans = buildRecoveryPlan(inventory)
    for (const plan of plans) {
      dispatch(addTab({ id: plan.tabId, title: plan.title }))
      dispatch(restoreLayout({ tabId: plan.tabId, layout: plan.layout, paneTitles: plan.paneTitles }))
    }
    armRecoveredTerminalRestores(store.getState(), plans.map((p) => p.tabId))
    setInventory(null); setResolved(true)
  }

  const decline = () => {
    if (inventory) recordDismissal(inventory.contentId)
    clearPendingOffer()
    setInventory(null); setResolved(true)
  }
  // render: null unless inventory; else portal dialog per Behavior item 2/5
}
```

`armRecoveredTerminalRestores(state, tabIds)`: for each tabId, read the tab's layout from the panes slice state, walk the tree, and for each leaf with `content.kind === 'terminal' && content.sessionRef` call `addTerminalRestoreRequestId(content.createRequestId)` (post-normalization id — the reducer re-minted it). Match how `App.tsx:1069` arms restores. Export it for direct unit testing if the component tests don't already cover it.

Export `getClientInstanceId` from `tabRegistrySync.ts` by adding `export` to (or a thin exported wrapper around) the existing private accessor the push envelope uses — no behavior change.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests + a11y lint**

Run: `npm run test:vitest -- run test/unit/client/components/RecoveryOfferPanel.test.tsx && npm run lint`
Expected: PASS, no jsx-a11y violations.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/components/RecoveryOfferPanel.tsx src/store/tabRegistrySync.ts test/unit/client/components/
git commit -m "feat(client): self-gating recover-my-panes offer panel with accept/decline (B3/P1.9)"
```

---

### Task 6: Client — App.tsx wiring (distinct Lane B3 region)

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/App.tsx` (ONLY: one import + one JSX line adjacent to the `SetupWizard` render at ~`App.tsx:1347-1362`; do NOT touch regions 811-898, 900-981, 1002-1090, 1283-1325)
- Modify: `test/unit/client/components/RecoveryOfferPanel.test.tsx` (no changes expected; listed for the re-run)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `RecoveryOfferPanel` (Task 5).
- Produces: the panel mounted app-wide.

- [ ] **Step 1: Make the change**

Import at the top of `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { RecoveryOfferPanel } from '@/components/RecoveryOfferPanel'
```

Adjacent to the `SetupWizard` JSX:

```tsx
{/* LANE B3 (recover-my-panes): self-gating recovery offer — see docs/plans/2026-07-26-recover-my-panes.md */}
<RecoveryOfferPanel />
```

(The component is fully self-gating, so unconditional render is correct and keeps the App.tsx footprint to two lines — mechanical-merge-friendly with Lane B1.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify nothing regressed**

Run: `env -u FRESHELL_BIND_HOST FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY="B3 recover-my-panes: app wiring" npm run test:vitest -- run test/unit/client/`
Expected: PASS. Then `npm run lint` — PASS.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add src/App.tsx
git commit -m "feat(client): mount recovery offer panel in App (Lane B3 region) (B3/P1.9)"
```

---

### Task 7: Client — full coordinated suite checkpoint

**Files:** none new — verification gate before e2e work.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the coordinated full suite**

Run: `env -u FRESHELL_BIND_HOST FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY="B3 recover-my-panes: pre-e2e checkpoint" npm test`
(WAIT if the coordinator gate is held by a sibling lane — check `npm run test:status`; never kill a foreign holder.)
Expected: green. Fix any breakage this lane introduced before proceeding (do not touch failures owned by other lanes' files — if a failure is in fenced files, record it and re-check `npm run test:status` for an advisory baseline before concluding it's ours).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the Rust workspace suite**

Run: `cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace`
Expected: green.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit (only if fixes were needed)**

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "test: stabilize recover-my-panes unit/integration coverage (B3)"
```

---

### Task 8: E2E — the browser-loss recovery spec

**Files:**
- Create: `test/e2e-browser/specs/recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts`
- Modify: the two registration lists that `pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts` appears in — `RUST_ONLY_SPECS` and the `rust-chromium` project `testMatch` (grep for `pane-ledger-restart-rust` to find both; add this spec the same way)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `RustServer` (`test/e2e-browser/helpers/rust-server.ts` — `homeDir` defaults to a fresh mkdtemp; `findFreePort()`; `restart()`), the fake-CLI installation + claude-pane creation pattern from `test/e2e-browser/specs/pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts:1-80` (`installFakeCli()` + fixtures `fake-claude-cli.mjs`), the `FAKE_CLAUDE_ARGV_LOG` JSONL and the `--session-id` extraction pattern (`pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts:162-168`), a claude-adapted adjacent-pair helper DEFINED IN THIS SPEC: `const hasClaudeResumePair = (argv: string[], sessionId: string) => { const i = argv.indexOf('--resume'); return i !== -1 && argv[i + 1] === sessionId }` — do NOT copy `hasResumePair` from `snapshot-restore-rust.spec.ts:66-70` verbatim: that helper matches codex's bare `resume` subcommand token (its only caller, `:273`, drives the codex CLI) and would NEVER match the fake claude CLI's `--resume <id>` flag (`fake-claude-cli.mjs:26-30`), which would make Scenario 1's accept-resume poll unpassable and Scenario 3's D7 negative assertion vacuous, the fake CLI's resume marker `claude: resumed session <id>` (`fake-claude-cli.mjs:26-30`), fresh-context storage-wipe pattern from `tabs-client-retire.spec.ts:6-38` (`browser.newContext()` = empty localStorage), `?token=<t>&e2e=1` URL scheme, `data-testid="recovery-offer-panel"` / `recovery-accept` / `recovery-decline` / `recovery-live-note` from Task 5.
- Produces: the campaign's first browser-loss recovery e2e.

Scenarios (all inside one spec file sharing one owned `RustServer` on an ephemeral port — NEVER 3001/3002; ESM imports use `.js` extensions):

**Scenario 1 — lose the browser, recover the panes (accept path):**
1. Start `RustServer` with its own `homeDir` and `installFakeCli()` (mirror `pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts` setup).
2. Context A: `browser.newContext()` → `page.goto(baseUrl + '/?token=' + token + '&e2e=1')` → create a claude CLI pane exactly the way `pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts` does (fake CLI) and let it bind (that spec's readiness waits) — this produces a ledger binding AND layout state. Record the pane's `sessionId` from the argv log's `--session-id` pair (the `pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts:162-168` extraction). ALSO create a browser pane pointed at `https://example.com` in the same tab (reuse whatever existing e2e helper/spec creates a browser pane; if none does it via UI, split the pane and pick the browser kind the way a user would) — this replaces the mixed-kind restore coverage that dies with `snapshot-restore-rust.spec.ts` (A12).
3. Wait for a snapshot to exist on disk: poll `fs.readdir(path.join(homeDir, '.freshell', 'tabs-snapshots'))` until a device dir with ≥1 `.json` generation appears (timeout 30s — pushes fire on ready + every 5s).
4. `await contextA.close()` — the "lost browser".
5. `await server.restart()` — the campaign scenario restarts the server too.
6. Context B: fresh `browser.newContext()` (empty storage = new machine) → `goto` the same URL.
7. `await expect(pageB.getByTestId('recovery-offer-panel')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 15000 })` and assert the heading matches `/restore \d+ pane/i`.
8. `await pageB.getByTestId('recovery-accept').click()` → panel disappears → assert a recreated terminal pane renders, then build the resume proof directly (`pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts` has NO resume assertion to reuse — it only polls ledger files and checks `--session-id` preallocation):
   - PRIMARY: poll the `FAKE_CLAUDE_ARGV_LOG` JSONL until an entry's argv contains the adjacent pair `--resume <sessionId>` for the sessionId recorded in step 2 (the `hasClaudeResumePair` helper from Interfaces — it searches for the `--resume` FLAG the fake claude CLI receives, not codex's bare `resume` token).
   - SECONDARY: the recreated pane's xterm text shows `claude: resumed session <id>` (`fake-claude-cli.mjs:26-30` emits it at CLI startup; scrollback replay delivers it to the late-attaching context).
   Also assert the browser pane from step 2 was recreated in context B (a browser-kind pane rendering `example.com` — assert via its testid/iframe src the way existing browser-pane specs do).
9. Same-browser reload guard: `await pageB.reload()` → wait for app ready → `await expect(pageB.getByTestId('recovery-offer-panel')).toHaveCount(0)` (localStorage now has a layout — no offer).

**Scenario 2 — decline path:**
1. Fresh context C against the same server (which still has snapshots + ledger rows from scenario 1's context A... note: context B's accepted layout also pushed snapshots — that is fine; recoverable state still exists).
2. Offer appears → `recovery-decline` click → panel gone → assert no recovered tabs were added (tab strip shows only the auto-created default tab).

Dismissal-across-reload persistence is proven at unit level (Task 3/5); e2e scenario 2 proves the user-visible decline behavior.

**Scenario 3 — no-restart browser loss (live session ⇒ recreate WITHOUT resume, D7):**
1. Fresh context D against the SAME still-running server (do NOT restart). Context D's localStorage is empty and the server still holds recoverable state from scenarios 1-2, so the recovery offer MODAL (Task 5: `role="dialog"`, overlay) appears first and would intercept all pointer events — clear it BEFORE any pane interaction: `await expect(pageD.getByTestId('recovery-offer-panel')).toBeVisible(...)` → `recovery-decline` click → panel gone (this dismissal lives only in D's localStorage; context E in step 3 is a different fresh context and is unaffected). THEN create a new fake-claude pane (scenario 1's pattern), record its `sessionId` from the argv log (`--session-id` extraction) and the argv log's current entry count, and wait for a snapshot generation that includes it.
2. `await contextD.close()` WITHOUT restarting the server — the claude PTY stays Running (registry-owned, not connection-owned).
3. Fresh context E → the offer appears (the new session changed the recoverable substance, so scenario 2's dismissal does not suppress it) → assert the live-session note `recovery-live-note` is visible.
4. `recovery-accept` click → panel disappears → a terminal pane is recreated → assert NO new `--resume <thatSessionId>` adjacent pair was appended to `FAKE_CLAUDE_ARGV_LOG` beyond the entry count recorded in step 1 — check with `hasClaudeResumePair` over the entries past that count (this negative assertion cannot pass vacuously: Scenario 1's PRIMARY poll already proves the same matcher matches a real `--resume` pair) (the live pane was recreated WITHOUT resume; the running session was left untouched — D7).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing spec**

Write the spec per the scenarios above, copying the harness scaffolding verbatim from `pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts` (imports with `.js` extensions, `ensureRustServerBuilt`, server lifecycle in `test.beforeAll`/`afterAll`, fake CLI install). Register it in both lists.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails only on the new assertions**

Run: `npx playwright test test/e2e-browser/specs/recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts --project=rust-chromium`
Expected at this point: PASS (the feature is already implemented in Tasks 1-6) — but run it BEFORE trusting it: if it passes, deliberately verify the test tests something by temporarily commenting out the `<RecoveryOfferPanel />` line in `App.tsx` and re-running — it must FAIL on step 7's visibility assertion. Restore the line. (This is the red-verification for an e2e written after its feature tasks; do not skip it.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Stabilize**

Fix selector/timing issues until the spec passes 2 consecutive runs. Common traps already known: the auto-created shell tab races the offer (irrelevant — eligibility is boot-captured); snapshot push cadence is 5s (the fs poll in step 3 handles it); `RustServer` restart keeps the port.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add test/e2e-browser/
git commit -m "test(e2e): browser-loss recover-my-panes proof - offer, accept-resume, mixed-kind, reload guard, decline, live no-restart (B3/P1.9)"
```

### Task 9: Delete the operator restore endpoint + marker/fence machinery (kata h9vt cleanup)

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/tabs_snapshots.rs` (remove the `POST /api/tabs-sync/restore` route + handler, `restore_lock`, the exactly-one-browser gate, marker usage, the delivery fence including the `send_capture_to` call at `tabs_snapshots.rs:241`, and `pane_to_create_body` usage; KEEP the read side — the `GET /api/tabs-sync/snapshots[/{device_id}]` routes and `get_snapshot` SURVIVE)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/tabs_snapshots_selectors.rs` — NOT deleted wholesale: KEEP `parse_selector` + `Selector` (consumed by the surviving `get_snapshot` handler at `tabs_snapshots.rs:129`; the GET endpoints have live external consumers — `scripts/deploy-tab-diff.sh:53,66,88` curls them, and the read tests `tabs_snapshots_tests.rs:105-195` cover the selector cases); DELETE only `parse_restore_selection` (`tabs_snapshots_selectors.rs:66-118`) and its tests
- Delete: `crates/freshell-server/src/tabs_snapshots_marker.rs`, `crates/freshell-server/src/tabs_snapshots_create_body.rs`, their test siblings, `scripts/restore-tabs.sh`
- Delete: `test/e2e-browser/specs/snapshot-restore-rust.spec.ts` (drives the deleted endpoint end-to-end) and remove it from both registration lists — its unique coverage already moved in Task 8 (browser-pane mixed-kind recreation; the `hasResumePair` argv pattern)
- Modify: `scripts/deploy-tab-diff.sh` (`:279-303` — the remediation text tells the operator to run `scripts/restore-tabs.sh`; rewrite it to point at the UI recovery flow)
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/specs/deploy-tab-diff-rust.spec.ts` (`:216` asserts the old remediation message — update to the new text; `:238,267,413` actually EXECUTE `restore-tabs.sh` — those sections belong to the deleted machinery: rework or delete them while PRESERVING the spec's diff-detection coverage)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` (remove the restore route merge + dead `mod` decls)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/screenshot.rs` per the Step 2 audit table (the broker lives in the freshell-ws LIBRARY crate — `crates/freshell-server/src/screenshot.rs` does NOT exist, and `crates/freshell-server/src/screenshots.rs`, the `POST /api/screenshots` REST handler, SURVIVES; P2.17 sanctions the fence-machinery deletion)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new. Preserves: `freshell_ws::tabs_persist` read selectors (used by Task 2) and the entire write path (untouched).
- Produces: no `POST /api/tabs-sync/restore`; the store's only consumers are the push write path and `GET /api/recovery/inventory`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the blast radius**

```bash
grep -rn "tabs-sync/restore\|tabs_snapshots_marker\|restore-tabs.sh\|pane_to_create_body\|send_capture_to\|parse_selector\|parse_restore_selection\|tabs_snapshots_selectors\|deploy-tab-diff\|snapshot-restore-rust" --include='*.rs' --include='*.sh' --include='*.ts' --include='*.md' crates/ scripts/ src/ test/ docs/development/ | grep -v docs/plans/
```
Expected consumers (all accounted for by this task — the STOP branch must not fire on these):
- the endpoint's own module/tests, `main.rs` wiring (`:785-794`), `scripts/restore-tabs.sh`;
- the fence caller `tabs_snapshots.rs:241` → broker method `crates/freshell-ws/src/screenshot.rs:244` (see the Step 2 audit table);
- `parse_selector` consumed by the SURVIVING `get_snapshot` (`tabs_snapshots.rs:129`) + the read tests (`tabs_snapshots_tests.rs:105-195`) — KEPT, not deleted;
- the two deploy-tab-diff consumers: `scripts/deploy-tab-diff.sh:279-303` (remediation text — REWRITTEN to the UI flow) and `test/e2e-browser/specs/deploy-tab-diff-rust.spec.ts:216,238,267,413` (REWORKED, diff-detection coverage preserved);
- `test/e2e-browser/specs/snapshot-restore-rust.spec.ts` (DELETED — drives the endpoint; coverage moved in Task 8);
- stale doc comments only: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/terminal_tabs.rs:191,614` (comments in the FENCED B4 crate — leave them, note in the final report) and `crates/freshell-ws/src/tabs_persist_validation_tests.rs:113` (update the comment).

If ANYTHING else consumes these (another route, a doc under `docs/development/` describing operator procedure), list it in the commit message and update/delete it too. If a consumer exists that the UI flow does not replace — STOP and report (that would reopen the h9vt disposition).

- [ ] **Step 2: Delete — audit table for freshell-ws, compiler-driven WITHIN freshell-server**

Remove the route merge from `main.rs` first, then the handler + machinery, then the files. Iterate `cargo check -p freshell-server` until clean; WITHIN `freshell-server` every `dead_code` warning that appears in touched modules is machinery the fence/marker existed for — delete it (context poison), do not `#[allow]` it.

In `tabs_snapshots_selectors.rs`, delete ONLY `parse_restore_selection` (`:66-118`) and its tests; `parse_selector` + `Selector` stay (the surviving `get_snapshot` consumes them at `tabs_snapshots.rs:129` — deleting them is a hard compile error AND breaks the surviving GET API).

For `crates/freshell-ws/src/screenshot.rs` the compiler CANNOT drive: `pub` items in a library crate get no `dead_code` lint when their cross-crate consumer dies — `exclusive_client_id` and `has_client` are already consumer-less today under the required `-D warnings` CI gate, proving the compiler stays silent on exactly this surface. Apply this explicit audit table instead:

| Item in `crates/freshell-ws/src/screenshot.rs` | Fate | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `send_capture_to` (`:244`) | DELETE + its unit tests | only consumer was the fence caller, `tabs_snapshots.rs:241` |
| `register_for_client` (`:138`) | DELETE + its unit tests | only consumer `tabs_snapshots.rs:238` |
| `send_to_client` (`:200`) | DELETE + its unit tests | all consumers die with `tabs_snapshots.rs` (`:578,:581,:629,:672,:803`) |
| `client_snapshot` (`:115`) | DELETE + its unit tests | only consumer `tabs_snapshots.rs:430` |
| `exclusive_client_id` (`:110`), `has_client` (`:124`) | DELETE + their unit tests | consumer-less already today |
| `register`, `send_capture`, `cancel`, `resolve_from`, `add_capable_client`, `remove_capable_client`, `has_capable_client`, `ScreenshotBroker::new` | KEEP | live consumers survive: `crates/freshell-server/src/screenshots.rs:104-128` (the surviving `POST /api/screenshots` REST handler) and `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs:178,436,681` |
| `register_expected` (`:146`, private) | KEEP | shared helper of the surviving `register` |

Rewrite `scripts/deploy-tab-diff.sh:279-303`: the remediation instructions must stop referencing `scripts/restore-tabs.sh` and instead direct the operator to the UI recovery flow (open a fresh browser context against the server — the recover-my-panes offer surfaces the snapshot; wording flexible). Update `test/e2e-browser/specs/deploy-tab-diff-rust.spec.ts` to match: `:216` asserts the old message — update it to the new text; `:238,267,413` EXECUTE `restore-tabs.sh` — rework or delete those sections while PRESERVING the spec's diff-detection coverage. Delete `test/e2e-browser/specs/snapshot-restore-rust.spec.ts` and its entries in both registration lists (its unique coverage moved in Task 8).

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify the full workspace + client suites stay green**

Run: `cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace`
Expected: PASS with the restore/marker test files gone; if any REMAINING test fails because it exercised restore machinery, that test belonged to the deleted feature — delete it; if it fails for any other reason, fix the code, not the test.
Run: `npx playwright test test/e2e-browser/specs/recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts test/e2e-browser/specs/deploy-tab-diff-rust.spec.ts --project=rust-chromium`
Expected: PASS (proves the UI flow never depended on the deleted machinery, and the reworked deploy-tab-diff spec still covers diff detection).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor(server): delete operator tabs-sync restore endpoint, write-ahead marker, and screenshot delivery fence

Kata h9vt disposition: Option A. The tabs-snapshots store is now load-bearing
via GET /api/recovery/inventory + the client recover-my-panes flow. The
server-push restore machinery (marker, one-browser gate, delivery fence,
scripts/restore-tabs.sh, parse_restore_selection) served only the blind
operator push and has no UI-flow consumer; the unreachable fence was flagged
for deletion in campaign P2.17. The GET snapshots read API, parse_selector,
and the broadcast screenshot broker survive (audit table in the plan);
deploy-tab-diff remediation now points at the UI recovery flow."
```

---

### Task 10: Final verification + push

**Files:** none.

- [ ] **Step 1: Full gates, in order**

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace
npm run lint
env -u FRESHELL_BIND_HOST FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY="B3 recover-my-panes: final verification" npm run check
npx playwright test test/e2e-browser/specs/recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts --project=rust-chromium
```
Expected: all green. (`npm run check` = typecheck + coordinated full suite; WAIT on the coordinator gate if held.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Push the branch — STOP before any PR**

```bash
git push -u origin feat/recover-my-panes
```
Do NOT run `gh pr create` — PR creation is not approved for this lane.

- [ ] **Step 3: Report**

The lane's final report must include: branch name, the green-suite evidence (commands + outcomes), the e2e proof summary, and this kata disposition statement: **"Kata h9vt resolved as Option A: tabs-snapshots is now load-bearing (layout half of the recover-my-panes flow via GET /api/recovery/inventory); the operator POST /api/tabs-sync/restore endpoint, write-ahead marker, exactly-one-browser gate, screenshot delivery fence, and scripts/restore-tabs.sh were deleted as UI-flow-irrelevant per the 'reuse what serves the UI flow, delete what doesn't' directive and P2.17. The GET /api/tabs-sync/snapshots read API and parse_selector survive (deploy-tab-diff consumes them), and deploy-tab-diff's remediation now points at the UI recovery flow."**

The final report must ALSO state:
1. **The D1 Principle-4 reconciliation, for explicit owner ratification:** the empty-client offer is sanctioned by campaign §4.4, which prescribes exactly "offer 'restore N panes from server memory?'" for this trigger; Decision 6's "recovery is automatic, never offered" scope list omits §4.4, so this plan reads the offer as the sanctioned behavior for the empty-client case. The owner should ratify (or overturn) that reading.
2. **The freshopencode fresh-start limitation, flagged to Lane B4:** recovered `freshopencode` panes start FRESH because `opencode_ws.rs` `handle_create` never reads `resume_session_id` (pre-existing bug, shared with `reopenClosedTab`; `crates/freshell-freshagent` is B4's fenced crate). The `sessionRef` passthrough is kept, so recovery becomes resume-correct the moment B4 fixes the handler.

## Self-Review Record

**1. Spec coverage:** (1) recover-my-panes flow — offer/trigger D1-D3 + Tasks 3/5/6 (boot-capture rationale corrected per A8, with the import-order invariants pinned and tested in Task 3); accept recreation honoring §4.2 D4-D5 + Tasks 1/4/5, including the A10 per-kind adapter (editor `content: ''` default, fresh-agent `restoreError` strip) with unit tests for editor/extension/picker; decline remembered Task 3/5, with the A5/A6 fix — `contentId` is sha256 over timestamp-free substance, so dismissal survives heartbeats, restarts, and Rust upgrades (tested: capturedAt/updatedAt bumps don't change it). (2) Liveness (A2/D7) — Task 1's third `live_session_keys` input + per-pane `live` flag, Task 2's read-only registry join, Task 2b's server-side guard on the direct sessionRef rung (failing integration test first), Task 4's sessionRef strip for live panes, Task 5's live note, Task 8 Scenario 3's no-restart proof (no new `--resume` pair). (3) Inventory correctness — `ledgerOnly` matched against effective refs across ALL device unions and excluding live rows (A4, tested), the A15 staleness rule dropping >15-min-silent clients (pure helper test + route test), the self-pollution filter including the A16 concurrent-client rule (same-fresh-browser multi-window junk can never win primary-device selection; pure helper test + a dedicated route test that forces the `bootAgoMs` → `boot_cutoff` wiring), auth'd. (4) kata h9vt — disposition section + Task 9 (Option A kept; Option B rejected with reason: ledger has no layout; the GET read API + `parse_selector` explicitly REUSED per A11; deploy-tab-diff remediation + spec reworked per A12; freshell-ws screenshot broker handled via the explicit A13 audit table since the compiler is silent for pub library items). TDD red-first for trigger conditions, inventory API, authority chain, liveness guard, dismissal — Tasks 1-5 + 2b all test-first; Task 8's e2e includes an explicit red-verification step. E2E — Task 8: three scenarios (restart accept-resume with argv-pair proof + browser-pane mixed-kind recreation, decline, no-restart live loss) with own RustServer/ephemeral ports/fresh contexts/same-browser-reload guard. Scope fence, a11y lint, PR policy — Global Constraints + Task 10 (which also carries the AD-1 §4.4 ratification statement and the B4 flag).

**1b. No silent deferrals:** no stubs or fake providers stand in for required behavior — the e2e uses the repo's established fake-CLI fixture (the same production-path proof used by the existing ledger restart e2e; it exercises the real create/resume path), and the Task 8 resume proof is built from the argv log + fixture marker (the previously-cited assertion did not exist — A14). Non-terminal pane recreation reuses the production `reopenClosedTab` restore path with a minimal per-kind adapter (D5/A10) — recreated, not deferred. Split geometry (D6) and editor buffer content (D6/A5) are not in the store — data facts, not deferrals. Two DOCUMENTED decisions with recorded rationale, not silent deferrals: (a) the freshopencode fresh-start limitation (Known-limitation note: fenced B4 crate owns the `opencode_ws.rs` bug; sessionRef passthrough kept forward-compatible; flagged to B4 in Task 10 Step 3); (b) live sessions are surfaced but NOT resumed (D7: attach-to-live rejected as unverified and colliding with Lane B1 ownership; server guard as defense-in-depth). No UNRESOLVED COVERAGE GAPS.

**2. Placeholder scan:** the `row_*` accessors, `digest16`, and `select_foreign_recent_generation_ids` (Task 1), `union_value`, `live_session_keys`, and the registry-handle type (Task 2), and the guard's row-matching (Task 2b) are named adapters against real definitions the implementer opens — each is bound to a concrete file/line source (`pane_ledger.rs:93`, `tabs_persist.rs:70-87`, `terminal.rs:1690-1745`, main.rs wiring), with tests as the arbiter. Task 9's freshell-ws deletions are an explicit per-method audit table, not a "compiler will say" hope. No TBD/TODO/"handle edge cases" items remain.

**3. Type consistency:** `DeviceUnion`/`select_foreign_recent_generation_ids`/`build_inventory` (Task 1, 3-arg signature) consumed verbatim in Task 2; the `live` field appears in Task 1's output schema, Task 4's `RecoveryPane` type and test fixtures, Task 5's `INVENTORY` fixture and live-note behavior, and Task 8 Scenario 3's assertions; `RecoveryInventory`/`RecoveryPane`/`RecoveryTabPlan` (Task 4) consumed in Task 5; `getClientInstanceId` exported in Task 5 and consumed there; testids `recovery-offer-panel`/`recovery-accept`/`recovery-decline`/`recovery-live-note` defined in Task 5, consumed in Task 8; `ledgerState` values (`bound|closed|gc_expired|unknown`) match between Task 1 output, Task 4 types, and tests; Task 2b's refusal frame mirrors the existing `RestoreUnavailable` shape consumed by the harness Task 2b's test copies; the D2 `bootAgoMs` chain is type-consistent end-to-end — `bootCapturedAtMs` (Task 3 boot-state) → `PendingOffer.bootAt` (Task 3 dismissal) → `getRecoveryInventory(clientInstanceId, bootAgoMs)` using the tuple-entries `buildQueryString` call shape that matches the REAL `api.ts:273` signature (Task 4) → `bootAgoMs` query param (`InventoryQuery.boot_ago_ms: Option<u64>` in Task 2's Step 3 snippet) → `boot_cutoff = now_ms().saturating_sub(...)` in the handler → 3-arg `read_foreign_unions(_, _, boot_cutoff)` → `select_foreign_recent_generation_ids(_, _, boot_cutoff)` (Tasks 1/2; optional-default-0 so Task 2's other route tests hold, and the wiring is FORCED by the dedicated `route_bootagoms_drops_concurrent_post_boot_clients` route test — real wall-clock fixtures, asserts a post-boot client is dropped with `bootAgoMs=30000` and kept without the param); Task 8's argv matcher `hasClaudeResumePair` targets the fake claude CLI's `--resume` flag, not codex's bare `resume` token, so the accept-resume poll can pass and the D7 negative assertion is non-vacuous.
