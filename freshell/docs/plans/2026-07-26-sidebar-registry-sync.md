# Sidebar/Tab-Registry Sync Re-Verification (P1.14) Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Re-verify the Incident-4 sidebar contract (correct pane↔session joins: across restarts, for REST-created tabs, for fresh codex terminals, and after recover-my-panes) against the new ledger-backed identity truth, pin each contract case with a test that would have caught Incident 4, and fix the cases that fail by making joins consult the identity registry/ledger per the §4.2 authority chain.

**Architecture:** All fixes are server-side; the client join machinery (`sessionsSlice`, `sidebarSelectors`, `Sidebar.tsx`) is verified but expected unchanged (the adoption→green fold path was validated end-to-end: `terminal.session.associated` → `App.tsx:1118` → `panesSlice.ts:1753-1789` → `hasTab`). Three server fixes: (1) the `GET /api/terminals` sidebar projection (`crates/freshell-server/src/terminals.rs:676-683`) stamps `sessionRef` from the `TerminalIdentityRegistry` (authority rung 1) instead of hard-coding `None` for codex — without this, the client's Phase-E synthesis (`sidebarSelectors.ts:437-490`) mints a `terminal:<id>` ghost row that no session-directory change can suppress; (2) the `sessions.changed` sweep signature gains an identity-registry digest so locator adoptions push a sidebar refetch; (3) the REST `/api/tabs` create path arms the codex locator (it already arms amplifier/opencode), making REST-created codex panes adoptable. VALIDATED PLAN CHANGE (load-bearing pass; ledger at `.worktrees/.the-usual-logs/sidebar-registry-sync/load-bearing-ledger.md`): the originally planned `PaneLedger` read fallback in `session_directory.rs` joins was investigated and its premise FALSIFIED — no production window exists where a live terminal's identity has a provider but no `session_id` while the ledger holds a Bound row for its CURRENT terminal id (every Bound writer upserts the registry with the session id first; terminal ids are never re-minted across restarts). `session_directory.rs`'s existing rung-1 registry consultation already collapses post-adoption duplicates (`:706-725`, dedupe `:786`); a rung-2 fallback would be dormant machinery (the historical D2 failure mode), so it is deliberately NOT built. Verification is pinned by new Rust unit tests plus one new rust-only Playwright spec covering all four contract cases.

**Tech Stack:** Rust (axum server, crates/freshell-server + freshell-ws + freshell-freshagent), React/Redux client (verified, not modified), Playwright e2e (`test/e2e-browser`), Vitest, cargo test/clippy.

## Global Constraints

- Base: `origin/main @ bf6242a1`. Work only in the worktree `/home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/sidebar-registry-sync` on branch `feat/sidebar-registry-sync`.
- SCOPE FENCE (from the lane spec, verbatim intent): you own sidebar/sessions client code (`sessionsSlice`, sidebar components), `crates/freshell-server/src/session_directory.rs`, and sessions-revision push seams. Do NOT touch: client reconcile fold / `TerminalView` / `FreshAgentView` pane-recovery internals (Lane C2 owns those), port/contract tooling + `shared/ws-protocol.ts` (Lane C3), `reconcile*.rs`, ledger WRITES (ledger READS are allowed; after the load-bearing pass none are required — the rung-2 fallback was validated out). Read anything. No kimi/gemini work.
  - One narrow, spec-mandated exception (case b/c: "identity now arrives via the B2 locator — is it now fixable with locator identity? If yes, fix it"): minimal codex-locator ARMING on the REST create path in `crates/freshell-freshagent` (Task 4), mirroring the existing amplifier/opencode wiring byte-for-byte in shape. Arming a locator is not a ledger write.
  - VALIDATION NOTE (load-bearing pass): the lane-spec exception text could not be located in any persisted document (the spec was an unpersisted pipeline prompt). Decision recorded as ACCEPTABLE with this interpretation: `arm()` adds no new ledger writer (the shared locator sweep remains the single pre-existing writer), and sanctioned campaign work already touched REST-path freshagent binding behavior (B4 fast-follow `2b3b4fa9`). The Verification Report MUST record this interpretation so the campaign owner can overrule at review.
- Scope note for Task 2 (validated plan change): `crates/freshell-server/src/terminals.rs` (the sidebar's terminal-directory feed projection) is treated as owned by this lane — it is not on the forbidden list, it is the sidebar-contract seam this lane exists to fix, and the fix is a registry READ (authority rung 1). Record this interpretation in the Verification Report alongside the Task 4 note.
- E2E: own `RustServer` instances via `test/e2e-browser/helpers/rust-server.ts`, ephemeral ports only — NEVER 3001/3002. `await server.stop()` in `finally`.
- NEVER restart the user's self-hosted Freshell server. NEVER use broad kill patterns (`pkill -f`, `pkill node`).
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` must pass (required CI).
- Coordinated vitest suites go through the shared gate: set `FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY`, check `npm run test:status`, and WAIT if another agent holds the gate (2 sibling lanes run concurrently). Playwright e2e is NOT gated.
- `npm ci` and `ln -s ../node_modules/tsx node_modules/tsx` may be needed in the worktree before vitest runs.
- Red-Green-Refactor TDD. Exception, mandated by this lane's verification-first spec: the e2e tests in Tasks 5–8 are PINNING tests for contract cases that may already hold — a pinning test passing on first run is a valid verification outcome (record PASS in the Verification Report); a failing one triggers that task's prescribed fix.
- PR POLICY: NOT approved. Push the branch, STOP before `gh pr create`. Final report = branch name + Verification Report + red→green proof.
- Check disk before heavy builds (`df -h .`); halt on ENOSPC risk rather than deleting anything outside the worktree.
- TS e2e/server files use NodeNext/ESM — relative imports need `.js` extensions.
- Do not create new end-user markdown docs; this plan doc is a working/agent doc and the Verification Report is appended to it (spec deliverable 3).
- Any new `SidebarSessionItem` field (not expected) must be added to all three memo comparators (`Sidebar.tsx:71`, `:125`, `:822`) or rows won't re-render.

## Background (read this first — it is the spec-coverage map)

Incident 4 (docs/plans/2026-07-19-state-sync-resilience-assessment.md): REST-created tabs rendered grey in the sidebar because the pane↔session join was built on client-guessed identity. The §4.2 authority chain (campaign plan, docs/plans/2026-07-24-restart-resilience-architecture-analysis.md:203) orders identity truth: **in-memory registry (live process truth) → ledger `bound` rows (durable server truth) → client claim (proposal only) → tabs-snapshot (rescue mirror)**.

How the sidebar joins today (verified at HEAD `bf6242a1`):

- Client: green vs grey is `item.hasTab` (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx:877`), derived from `collectSessionRefsFromTabs(tabs, panes)` (`src/lib/session-utils.ts:294`) reading canonical `content.sessionRef` on local pane trees. Server running-state arrives via `GET /api/session-directory` and `terminalDirectory`. DOM contract: `[data-session-id]`, `[data-provider]`, `[data-has-tab]`, `[data-is-running]` (`Sidebar.tsx:863-869`).
- Server: `crates/freshell-server/src/session_directory.rs` joins live terminals to indexed session files keyed ONLY on `provider:sessionId`, with `TerminalIdentityRegistry` as its sole identity source (`SessionDirectoryState`, `:66-84`). A live identity with no `session_id` mints a provisional key `terminal:<terminal_id>` (`:735-738`); post-adoption, this rung-1 registry consultation already joins and dedupes correctly (`:706-725`, dedupe `:786`) — validated.
- Terminal-directory feed: the sidebar ALSO reads `GET /api/terminals` (`src/lib/api.ts:353-366` → `terminalDirectorySlice`, consumed at `Sidebar.tsx:212-213`); its projection hard-codes `session_ref: None` for codex mode (`crates/freshell-server/src/terminals.rs:676-683`), never consulting identity. The client's Phase-E synthesis (`sidebarSelectors.ts:437-490`) mints `terminal:<id>` rows for running sessionRef-less non-shell terminals from THIS feed — the deciding seam for the "no ghost" assertions.
- Push: `sessions.changed` is emitted by `freshell_ws::terminal::broadcast_sessions_changed` (`crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs:2292`); the periodic sweep (`crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs:1490`) fires it when `sessions_sweep_signature` (`main.rs:1445`) changes — a signature derived ONLY from disk-indexed sessions, blind to identity-registry changes.

Known defects this plan fixes (found in exploration, each pinned by a task):

1. **Case (c) ghost row (the validated join gap):** the `/api/terminals` sidebar projection (`terminals.rs:676-683`) hard-codes `session_ref = None` for codex terminals, so even after adoption the client Phase-E synthesis (`sidebarSelectors.ts:437-490`) mints a `terminal:<id>` ghost row (`:462`) — its `:464` dedupe keys on the provisional key and it inherits `hasTab: true` (`:479`); adoption's own `terminal.meta.updated` triggers a refetch of exactly this unstamped feed. Also stale: `session_directory.rs` fence comment (`:682-690`), module doc (`:20-34`) and residual pinning test (`:949-974`) describe the pre-locator world. → Task 2. (The originally suspected defect here — "session_directory never consults the PaneLedger" — was validated and REJECTED as a fix target: no production rung-2 window exists; see the Architecture note.)
2. **Case (c) push:** locator adoption (`codex_identity.rs:138`) upserts identity + ledger but broadcasts no `sessions.changed`; the sweep signature can't see it either. The collapsed duplicate never renders. → Task 3.
3. **Case (b)/(c) REST:** `arm_locators_for_fresh_pane` (`crates/freshell-freshagent/src/terminal_tabs.rs:458-471`) arms only amplifier + opencode; a codex pane created via `POST /api/tabs` is never armed, so its provisional identity can never be superseded. → Task 4.

Contract-case → task map:

| Spec case | Pinning tests | Fix (if needed) |
|---|---|---|
| (a) restarts | Task 7 (e2e restart cycle, mixed panes) | Tasks 2–3 (server), else record PASS |
| (b) REST/MCP-created tabs (Incident 4) | Task 6 (e2e REST claude+codex resume), existing `remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts` re-run | Task 4 + Task 6 contingency |
| (c) fresh codex duplicate | Task 2 (unit), Task 5 (e2e collapse) | Tasks 2, 3, 4 |
| (d) recover-my-panes | Task 8 (e2e recovery + sidebar assert) | none expected; contingency in Task 8 |

## File Structure

- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/terminals.rs` — identity-stamped `session_ref` in the sidebar terminal projection + unit tests. (Sidebar directory feed seam — treated as owned; see Global Constraints scope note.)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/session_directory.rs` — rewritten residual pinning test, refreshed stale fence comment + module docs ONLY (no behavior change; the ledger-fallback was validated out).
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` — identity digest in `sessions_sweep_signature`; `spawn_sessions_sweep` new param; sweep tests. (Sessions-revision push seam — owned.)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/lib.rs` — `FreshAgentState.codex_locator` field + `with_codex_locator` builder (mirror of amplifier/opencode). (Narrow scope exception.)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/terminal_tabs.rs` — arm codex locator in `arm_locators_for_fresh_pane`; unit test. (Narrow scope exception.)
- Create: `test/e2e-browser/specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts` — the four contract-case scenarios.
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts` — register new spec in `RUST_ONLY_SPECS` and the `rust-chromium` project `testMatch`.
- Modify: `docs/plans/2026-07-26-sidebar-registry-sync.md` — Verification Report entries appended per task.

No client source files are expected to change. Tasks 6 and 8 contain explicit contingency instructions if verification proves otherwise (the contingent files — `src/store/sessionsSlice.ts`, `src/store/selectors/sidebarSelectors.ts`, `src/lib/session-utils.ts`, `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` — are owned by this lane).

### Task 1: Baseline and harness sanity

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/plans/2026-07-26-sidebar-registry-sync.md` (Verification Report baseline entry)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing (first task).
- Produces: a proven-working build/test harness in the worktree; a `## Verification Report` baseline entry. Later tasks assume `cargo test -p freshell-server` and `npm run test:vitest -- ...` both work here.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm worktree, branch, and disk headroom**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/sidebar-registry-sync
git status --short --branch && git log --oneline -1
df -h .
```
Expected: branch `feat/sidebar-registry-sync`, HEAD `bf6242a1` (plus this plan's commit), clean tree. If available disk < 10G, HALT and report (cargo release builds are heavy) — do not delete anything outside the worktree.

- [ ] **Step 2: Node deps + tsx symlink**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/sidebar-registry-sync
[ -d node_modules ] || npm ci
[ -e node_modules/tsx ] || ln -s ../node_modules/tsx node_modules/tsx
```
Expected: exits 0. (The symlink is the documented worktree workaround; skip if `node_modules/tsx` already resolves.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Rust baseline for the two crates this plan touches**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/sidebar-registry-sync
cargo test -p freshell-server session_directory 2>&1 | tail -20
cargo test -p freshell-freshagent 2>&1 | tail -5
```
Expected: both PASS (this is the merged waves A+B baseline). Note the current `session_directory` test count for the report.

- [ ] **Step 4: Targeted client baseline (uncoordinated single-file passthrough)**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/sidebar-registry-sync
FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY="P1.14 sidebar-registry-sync baseline" npm run test:vitest -- run --config config/vitest/vitest.config.ts test/unit/client/store/selectors/sidebarSelectors.test.ts test/unit/client/components/SidebarItem.running-state.test.tsx
```
Expected: PASS. If the coordinator gate is held by another agent, WAIT (check `npm run test:status`) — never kill a foreign holder.

- [ ] **Step 5: Record the baseline in the Verification Report**

Append under `## Verification Report` at the bottom of this file:
```markdown
### Baseline (Task 1)
- Worktree feat/sidebar-registry-sync @ bf6242a1: clean.
- cargo test -p freshell-server session_directory: PASS (<N> tests).
- cargo test -p freshell-freshagent: PASS.
- sidebarSelectors + SidebarItem.running-state vitest: PASS.
- Disk headroom: <X>G available.
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/plans/2026-07-26-sidebar-registry-sync.md
git commit -m "docs(p1.14): record verification baseline for sidebar-registry-sync"
```

### Task 2: Identity-stamped /api/terminals sidebar feed (rung-1 truth to the client)

VALIDATED REPLACEMENT for the original "ledger-backed join" task — that task's premise was falsified during the load-bearing pass (no production window for a rung-2 fallback; see the Architecture note). The REAL case-(c) join gap: the sidebar's terminal-directory feed, `GET /api/terminals`, hard-codes `session_ref = None` for codex-mode terminals in its sidebar projection (`crates/freshell-server/src/terminals.rs:676-683`) and never consults the `TerminalIdentityRegistry` — even after locator adoption has given the terminal a real session id. The client's Phase-E synthesis (`src/store/selectors/sidebarSelectors.ts:437-490`) then mints a `terminal:<id>` ghost row for the running, sessionRef-less non-shell terminal (`:462`); the `:464` dedupe keys on the provisional key (so the real indexed row cannot suppress the ghost) and the ghost even inherits `hasTab: true` (`:479`). Adoption's own `terminal.meta.updated` broadcast triggers a refetch of exactly this unstamped feed. Fix: stamp the projection from the identity registry (authority rung 1) so an adopted terminal's row carries its real session identity — Phase-E only synthesizes for sessionRef-less terminals, so the ghost then never materializes. Precedent: the wave-A WS-handshake inventory stamping (`crates/freshell-ws/src/lib.rs:441-450`) did exactly this for the WS path; this task does it for the REST feed the sidebar actually polls.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/terminals.rs` (sidebar projection at `:676-683` + the file's existing test module — follow its current test conventions)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/session_directory.rs` (Step 5 stale-doc/test refresh ONLY — no behavior change)
- Possibly Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` (only if the GET route's state lacks the registry handle — follow the compiler)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `freshell_ws::identity::TerminalIdentityRegistry` — the route already reaches identity state (the PATCH rename handler in the same file uses it at `terminals.rs:985-994`; reuse that handle/state field for the GET projection). The same registry is cloned into `SessionDirectoryState` at `main.rs:703`.
- Produces (Tasks 5 and 7's "no `terminal:<id>` ghost" e2e assertions rely on this): the sidebar terminal projection emits `session_ref: Some(...)` (provider + session id taken from the registry identity) for any live terminal whose identity carries a `session_id`; terminals with no identity or an identityless entry keep `session_ref: None` (today's behavior); any existing non-`None` stamping for other modes is preserved byte-for-byte.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests (RED)**

In `terminals.rs`'s test module, next to the existing projection tests (mirror their construction helpers — if no test exists for the sidebar projection helper, test the smallest function that builds the sidebar item for a live terminal):

1. `adopted_codex_terminal_is_stamped_with_its_registry_session_ref` — registry contains `("term-codex", Some("codex"), Some("real-codex-session-id"))`; the projected sidebar item for that terminal carries `session_ref` with provider `codex` and session id `real-codex-session-id` (today: hard-coded `None` → RED).
2. `identityless_codex_terminal_projection_is_unchanged` — registry has no entry (or an entry with `session_id: None`) for the terminal; the projected item's `session_ref` is `None` (byte-identical to today — this pins that we did not invent identity).

Use the registry's real `upsert` API (`TerminalIdentityRegistry::new()` + `upsert(id, provider, session_id, cwd, now_ms)` — same shape the `session_directory.rs` join tests use).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify they fail for the right reason**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-server terminals 2>&1 | tail -30`
Expected: test 1 FAILS on the `None` assertion (or a compile failure if the projection helper must first gain a registry parameter — both are correct REDs; the seam may not exist yet). Test 2 passes.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement (GREEN)**

In `terminals.rs`, in the sidebar projection (`:676-683` area): where `session_ref` is currently hard-coded `None` for codex mode, consult the identity registry for the terminal's id; if the identity has both a provider and a `session_id`, emit the stamped `session_ref`; otherwise keep `None`. Thread the registry handle from the route state the PATCH handler already uses (`:985-994`); if the specific projection helper is a pure function, add a registry (or resolved-identity) parameter and pass it from the handler — follow the compiler. Do NOT touch reconcile code or write to the ledger/registry anywhere in this task (reads only).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-server terminals 2>&1 | tail -30`
Expected: all PASS, including both new tests and all pre-existing terminals tests.

- [ ] **Step 5: Refresh the stale session_directory docs + residual pinning test (REFACTOR — no behavior change)**

In `crates/freshell-server/src/session_directory.rs`:
1. The test at `:949-974` (`codex_fresh_terminal_and_its_eventual_session_file_are_a_documented_residual_duplicate`) pins the OLD contract. Rename it to `codex_fresh_terminal_pre_adoption_duplicate_is_transient_pending_locator_adoption`, keep the `joined.len() == 2` assertion for the no-identity input, and rewrite its doc comment: the duplicate is a TRANSIENT pre-adoption window — the B2 codex locator adopts the identity (`codex_identity.rs`), after which the EXISTING rung-1 registry consultation here (`:706-725`, dedupe `:786`) collapses it and the identity-aware sweep (`main.rs`, Task 3) pushes it; it is no longer a permanent residual.
2. Update the fence comment at `:682-690` the same way (delete the "this port doesn't associate the two after the fact" claim; describe rung-1 resolution, the transient window, and note that a rung-2 ledger fallback was evaluated during planning and deliberately rejected — no production window exists where a live identity lacks a session_id while a Bound row covers its current terminal id).
3. Fix the stale module doc claims at `:20-34` ("claude only", "no live terminal join" — both false since long before this plan; say what the module actually does today).

- [ ] **Step 6: Full crate check + clippy**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-server 2>&1 | tail -5
cargo clippy -p freshell-server --all-targets -- -D warnings 2>&1 | tail -5
```
Expected: PASS / no warnings.

- [ ] **Step 7: Record + commit**

Append to the Verification Report:
```markdown
### Case (c) join/ghost, server unit level (Task 2)
- VERIFIED FAILING then FIXED: /api/terminals sidebar projection hard-coded
  session_ref = None for codex; an adopted terminal's row now carries its
  registry session identity (rung 1), so the client Phase-E terminal:<id>
  ghost never materializes. RED proof: assertion-level (or compile-level if
  the seam was threaded), then green.
- Validated non-change: the rung-2 PaneLedger fallback in session_directory
  joins was evaluated and REJECTED (no production window; dormant-machinery
  risk). Existing rung-1 consultation already collapses post-adoption
  duplicates. Residual pinning test rewritten: pre-adoption duplicate is
  transient, not permanent.

### Task 3: Identity-aware sessions.changed sweep (the push seam)

Even a perfect join is invisible if nothing pushes. The sweep signature is currently blind to `TerminalIdentityRegistry` changes, so a locator adoption (or any terminal open/close of a coding CLI) never triggers a sidebar refetch. Fold an identity digest into the signature. (This deliberately routes through the existing single emit point `broadcast_sessions_changed` and stays inside the sweep — the documented push seam this lane owns — rather than adding a second producer in the adoption tail.) Validated attribution caveat: for FRESH codex panes the rollout write itself usually also moves the disk signature within ~≤4s, so this digest is what guarantees a push for adoptions that do NOT touch disk (e.g. adoption against an already-indexed rollout) and for terminal open/close — credit it accordingly in the report, not for row collapse.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` (`sessions_sweep_signature` at `:1445-1450`, `spawn_sessions_sweep` at `:1490-1509`, spawn site at `:664`, gap docs at `:1390-1444`, `mod sessions_sweep_tests` at `:1512`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `freshell_ws::identity::TerminalIdentityRegistry::list() -> Vec<TerminalIdentity>` (`identity.rs:124`, live-only); the `terminal_identity` registry binding already cloned into `SessionDirectoryState` at `main.rs:703`.
- Produces:
  - `fn sessions_sweep_signature(items: &[IndexedSession], identities: &[TerminalIdentity]) -> (usize, i64, u64)`
  - `fn spawn_sessions_sweep(session_index: Arc<SessionIndex>, ws_state: WsState, identity: TerminalIdentityRegistry, interval: Duration)`
  - Behavioral guarantee Task 5's e2e relies on: a locator adoption changes the signature within one 2s tick → `sessions.changed` → client refetch.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test (RED)**

In `mod sessions_sweep_tests` (`main.rs:1512`):

```rust
/// The undocumented fourth gap, closed: the sweep signature must move when
/// the identity registry changes -- a locator adoption (session_id appears
/// on a live terminal) alters the session-directory join result, so the
/// sidebar needs a sessions.changed push.
#[test]
fn identity_registry_changes_move_the_sweep_signature() {
    let identity = freshell_ws::identity::TerminalIdentityRegistry::new();
    let items: Vec<IndexedSession> = Vec::new();

    let empty = sessions_sweep_signature(&items, &identity.list());

    identity.upsert("term-1", Some("codex"), None, None, 1_000);
    let with_terminal = sessions_sweep_signature(&items, &identity.list());
    assert_ne!(empty, with_terminal, "a new live coding terminal must move the signature");

    identity.upsert("term-1", Some("codex"), Some("thread-a"), None, 2_000);
    let adopted = sessions_sweep_signature(&items, &identity.list());
    assert_ne!(with_terminal, adopted, "locator adoption must move the signature");

    identity.retire("term-1");
    let retired = sessions_sweep_signature(&items, &identity.list());
    assert_ne!(adopted, retired, "terminal exit must move the signature");
}

/// updated_at alone must NOT move the signature -- it changes on every
/// heartbeat-ish upsert and would turn the sweep into a 2s firehose.
#[test]
fn identity_updated_at_alone_does_not_move_the_sweep_signature() {
    let identity = freshell_ws::identity::TerminalIdentityRegistry::new();
    let items: Vec<IndexedSession> = Vec::new();
    identity.upsert("term-1", Some("codex"), Some("thread-a"), None, 1_000);
    let a = sessions_sweep_signature(&items, &identity.list());
    identity.upsert("term-1", Some("codex"), Some("thread-a"), None, 9_000);
    let b = sessions_sweep_signature(&items, &identity.list());
    assert_eq!(a, b);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-server sessions_sweep 2>&1 | tail -20`
Expected: compile FAILURE (`sessions_sweep_signature` takes 1 arg). Correct RED.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement (GREEN)**

```rust
// main.rs -- replaces :1445-1450
/// Signature of the session-directory view as the sidebar sees it:
/// disk corpus (count + max activity) PLUS a digest of the live identity

fn sessions_sweep_signature(
    items: &[IndexedSession],
    identities: &[freshell_ws::identity::TerminalIdentity],
) -> (usize, i64, u64) {
    use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
    let max_last_activity_at = items.iter().map(|s| s.last_activity_at).max().unwrap_or(0);
    let mut refs: Vec<(&str, &str, &str)> = identities
        .iter()
        .map(|i| (
            i.terminal_id.as_str(),
            i.provider.as_deref().unwrap_or(""),
            i.session_id.as_deref().unwrap_or(""),
        ))
        .collect();
    refs.sort_unstable();
    let mut hasher = std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher::new();
    refs.hash(&mut hasher);
    (items.len(), max_last_activity_at, hasher.finish())
}
```

`spawn_sessions_sweep` (`:1490`): add param `identity: freshell_ws::identity::TerminalIdentityRegistry`, and compute both the initial and per-tick signatures as `sessions_sweep_signature(&items, &identity.list())`. At the spawn site (`main.rs:664`) pass `terminal_identity.clone()` (the same registry handle used at `:703`). Update the existing sweep tests to the new arity (pass `&TerminalIdentityRegistry::new().list()` i.e. `&[]`-equivalent where identity is irrelevant). Update the KNOWN-GAPS doc block (`:1390-1444`): gap 4 (identity blindness) is now CLOSED here; note the deliberate exclusion of `updated_at` and `cwd` from the digest.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-server sessions_sweep 2>&1 | tail -20` then `cargo test -p freshell-server 2>&1 | tail -5`
Expected: PASS, including `new_older_session_file_is_still_detected_as_a_change` at the new arity.

- [ ] **Step 5: Clippy + commit**

```bash
cargo clippy -p freshell-server --all-targets -- -D warnings 2>&1 | tail -5
git add crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs docs/plans/2026-07-26-sidebar-registry-sync.md

### Task 4: Arm the codex locator on the REST /api/tabs create path

A codex pane created via the REST agent API is never armed for locator adoption (only amplifier/opencode are), so its provisional identity is permanent — the strictly-worse variant of the Incident-4 case. Mirror the existing wiring.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/lib.rs` (FreshAgentState fields/builders — locate the existing `with_amplifier_locator`/`with_opencode_locator` definitions and mirror them)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/terminal_tabs.rs:458-471` (`arm_locators_for_fresh_pane`) + its test module
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs:358-361` (builder wiring; codex locator constructed at `main.rs:349-350`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `freshell_sessions::codex_locator::CodexLocator` (`arm` at `codex_locator.rs:166`, `armed_count` at `:152`, `note_submit` at `:212`); the shared `Arc<CodexLocator>` at `main.rs:349-350` (the one the WS sweep `spawn_codex_locator_sweep` uses).
- Produces: `FreshAgentState::with_codex_locator(self, locator: Arc<CodexLocator>) -> Self`; `arm_locators_for_fresh_pane` arms codex. Task 5's e2e scenario 1 (REST-created codex pane collapses to one green row) depends on this.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test (RED)**

In `terminal_tabs.rs`'s test module, next to the existing create-path tests (e.g. `create_amplifier_tab_with_legacy_resume_synthesizes_session_ref` — mirror how those tests construct a `FreshAgentState`):

```rust
/// P1.14 / Incident-4 hardening: the REST create path must arm the codex
/// locator exactly like amplifier/opencode, or a REST-created codex pane's
/// provisional identity can never be superseded by B2 adoption.
#[test]
fn arm_locators_for_fresh_pane_arms_the_codex_locator() {
    let root = std::env::temp_dir().join(format!("codex-arm-{}", std::process::id()));
    std::fs::create_dir_all(&root).unwrap();
    let locator = std::sync::Arc::new(
        freshell_sessions::codex_locator::CodexLocator::new(root));
    let state = /* construct the minimal FreshAgentState the sibling
                   create-path tests use */
        .with_codex_locator(Some(locator.clone()));
    // Some(...) matches the sibling test-helper convention: the existing
    // locator tests pass Some(std::sync::Arc::new(...)) (terminal_tabs.rs:2327-2337)
    // because the builders take Option (with_amplifier_locator, lib.rs:362-368).

    arm_locators_for_fresh_pane(&state, "term-codex-1", "codex", Some("/tmp/proj"), None);

    assert_eq!(locator.armed_count(), 1, "codex mode must arm the codex locator");
}
```

Copy the `arm(...)` argument shape (arg order, `now_ms`) from the existing amplifier arm call at `terminal_tabs.rs:585` adjusted to `CodexLocator::arm`'s signature (`codex_locator.rs:166`) — cross-check against the WS-path codex arming call in `crates/freshell-ws/src/codex_association.rs` and use the identical shape.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent arm_locators 2>&1 | tail -20`
Expected: compile FAILURE — no `with_codex_locator`, no `codex_locator` field. Correct RED.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement (GREEN)**

1. `lib.rs`: add field + builder, byte-for-byte mirroring the amplifier pair — the amplifier builder takes `Option<Arc<...>>` and assigns it directly (`with_amplifier_locator`, `lib.rs:362-368`), so the codex sibling must too:
```rust
    codex_locator: Option<std::sync::Arc<freshell_sessions::codex_locator::CodexLocator>>,
```
```rust
    pub fn with_codex_locator(
        mut self,
        locator: Option<std::sync::Arc<freshell_sessions::codex_locator::CodexLocator>>,
    ) -> Self {
        self.codex_locator = locator;
        self
    }
```
Also add `codex_locator: None,` to the `Self::new` struct literal, alongside the existing `amplifier_locator: None` / `opencode_locator: None` defaults (`lib.rs:247-248`) — the struct will not compile without it.
2. `terminal_tabs.rs:458-471`, extend `arm_locators_for_fresh_pane`:
```rust
    if let Some(locator) = &state.codex_locator {
        locator.arm(terminal_id, mode, true, resume_session_id, cwd /* + now_ms if the signature takes it -- match codex_association.rs */);
    }
```
3. `main.rs:358-361`: chain `.with_codex_locator(codex_locator.clone())` where amplifier/opencode are wired. This clones the whole `Option<Arc<CodexLocator>>` binding from `main.rs:349-350` — exactly the shape the existing `.with_amplifier_locator(amplifier_locator.clone())` call passes — and must sit BEFORE `codex_locator` is later moved into the `ws_state` construction.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent 2>&1 | tail -5` and `cargo test -p freshell-server 2>&1 | tail -5`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify the Enter-anchor path for REST-driven input (verification step with prescribed conditional fix)**

The codex locator is Enter-anchored (`note_submit`, `codex_locator.rs:212`). Verify where `note_submit` is called:
```bash
grep -rn "note_submit" crates/ --include="*.rs" | grep -v "codex_locator.rs\|_tests\|tests/"
```
- If the call sites live on the shared terminal-input/registry write path (reached by BOTH browser keystrokes and REST `POST /api/panes/:id/send-keys`): record "note_submit: shared path, REST covered" in the Verification Report. No change.
- If the codex call sites are WS-handler-only (REST send-keys never anchors the codex window — this is the expected grep outcome: `maybe_send_keys`, `terminal_tabs.rs:1238-1294`, feeds only the amplifier/opencode locators today): add a codex call to that handler with THREE constraints the existing amplifier/opencode calls do NOT share:
  1. **Order — BEFORE the PTY write.** The codex locator's contract (`codex_association.rs:49-56`) requires the first `note_submit`'s `known_files` re-snapshot to COMPLETE before the Enter byte reaches the PTY — a re-snapshot racing after the write can capture (permanently exclude) the pane's own rollout file. `maybe_send_keys` is synchronous, so a plain call placed before `registry.input(&terminal_id, text.as_bytes())` (`terminal_tabs.rs:1275`) satisfies the ordering. Leave the existing after-write amplifier/opencode calls (`:1287/:1290`) exactly where they are — their `note_submit` is cheap and carries no such contract.
  2. **Gate — the handler's existing crate-local `is_submit_input`** (`terminal_tabs.rs:1301-1303`, the same bare-CR/LF-run rule every WS association gate uses). Do NOT gate on `contains('\r')` (that matches `"hello\r\n"`, which is not a submit) and do NOT import the gate from `freshell-ws` (circular dependency — see `lib.rs:168-171`).
  3. **No mode check.** There is no `mode` binding in this handler and none is needed: `CodexLocator::note_submit` no-ops for terminals the locator never armed, and only codex panes are armed.
```rust
    // Insert BEFORE the existing `registry.input(&terminal_id, text.as_bytes());`
    // at terminal_tabs.rs:1275:
    if is_submit_input(text) {
        if let Some(locator) = &state.codex_locator {
            // Contract (codex_association.rs:49-56): must complete before the
            // Enter byte reaches the PTY. Synchronous call before the write =
            // ordered. First submit does a bounded sessions-tree walk; later
            // submits are a cheap mutex hop.
            locator.note_submit(&terminal_id, now_ms());
        }
    }
```
  …with a sibling unit test asserting `note_submit` armed-window behavior (mirror the WS-path test if one exists), and record "note_submit: REST path added (before-write, is_submit_input-gated)" in the report. Either branch MUST leave a report entry.

- [ ] **Step 6: Clippy (workspace — this task touched 2 crates) + commit**

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings 2>&1 | tail -5
git add crates/freshell-freshagent crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs docs/plans/2026-07-26-sidebar-registry-sync.md
git commit -m "feat(freshagent): arm the codex locator on the REST /api/tabs create path (P1.14)"
```
Append to the Verification Report:
```markdown
### Case (b)/(c) REST codex arming (Task 4)
- VERIFIED FAILING then FIXED: REST-created codex panes were never armed for
  B2 locator adoption. Now armed, mirroring amplifier/opencode.

```

### Task 5: E2E pinning spec — scenario 1: fresh codex duplicate collapses (case c)

Create the new rust-only Playwright spec and its first scenario: a codex pane created via the REST agent API, driven with Enter in the browser, must end as exactly ONE green sidebar row carrying the real session id — no grey row, no client-minted `terminal:<id>` ghost — without a manual refresh. VALIDATED RED PREDICTION for `bf6242a1`: the deterministic failure is the `data-has-tab='true'` timeout (the pre-fix REST path never arms the codex locator, so adoption never fires and the row never turns green); the count/`startsWith('terminal:')` assertions may ADDITIONALLY fail via a client Phase-E ghost from the unstamped `/api/terminals` feed. It passes with Tasks 2–4 plus the verified existing client fold (`terminal.session.associated` → `panesSlice.ts:1753-1789` → `hasTab`). This is the "would have caught Incident 4" test for the codex shape.

**Files:**
- Create: `test/e2e-browser/specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts`
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts` (add the spec to `RUST_ONLY_SPECS` AND to the `rust-chromium` project's `testMatch`, each with a one-line justification comment, matching every existing entry's style)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `RustServer` (`test/e2e-browser/helpers/rust-server.ts:272` — direct import, so `restart()`/`restartAbrupt()` are non-optional); fixture `test/e2e-browser/fixtures/fake-codex-terminal.mjs` (writes a real rollout on first Enter, argv log var `FAKE_CODEX_TERMINAL_ARGV_LOG`); sidebar DOM contract `[data-session-id][data-provider][data-has-tab]` (`Sidebar.tsx:863-869`); server behavior from Tasks 2–4.
- Produces: the spec file scaffold (serial suite, one shared server, helpers) that Tasks 6–8 extend; scenario name `case-c: fresh codex terminal collapses to a single green row`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the spec scaffold + scenario (this IS the failing-test step)**

Create `test/e2e-browser/specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts`. Per this suite's per-spec-ownership convention, copy these helpers VERBATIM from their donors (cite the donor in a comment above each, as sibling specs do):
- `installFakeCli(binDir, name, source)` — donor `pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts:29`
- `bootAndConnect(page, info)` + `selectShellIfPickerShowing(page)` — donor `remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts:60-86`
- `readArgvLog(logPath)` — donor `remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts:89-93`
- the REST `POST /api/tabs` request shape — donor `remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts:197` (same headers/auth; body swaps provider/mode per scenario)

Structure (fill helper bodies from the donors; everything else below is complete):

```ts
/**
 * P1.14 sidebar/tab-registry sync re-verification (Lane C1).
 * Pins the Incident-4 sidebar contract against ledger-backed identity:
 *  case-c: fresh codex duplicate collapse (this task)
 *  case-b: REST-created tabs are green + dedupe   (Task 6)
 *  case-a: joins survive server restart            (Task 7)
 *  case-d: joins correct after recover-my-panes    (Task 8)
 * Owns a RustServer directly (ephemeral loopback port -- NEVER 3001/3002).

    await page.keyboard.press('Enter')

    // THE CONTRACT: eventually exactly ONE codex sidebar row, green, and

      expect(sessionId?.startsWith('terminal:')).toBe(false)
    }).toPass({ timeout: 45_000 })
  })
})
```

Row-locator note: assert with `[data-provider="codex"][data-session-id]`; if the sidebar list needs scoping use the list container test id (`data-testid="sidebar-session-list"`, per `Sidebar.tsx:770` area) — verify the exact attribute set in `Sidebar.tsx:863-869` while writing.

Register the spec in `playwright.config.ts`:
- `RUST_ONLY_SPECS`: add `'sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts'` with comment `// imports RustServer directly; restart()/ledger semantics are rust-only (P1.14)`.
- `rust-chromium` project `testMatch`: add the same filename.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails on the pre-fix behavior — or passes with fixes in place**

Prereq (once per e2e session): `cargo build --release -p freshell-server` happens inside the fixture; the client build happens in global-setup. Run:
```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/sidebar-registry-sync
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -30
```
Since Tasks 2–4 are already merged into this branch, expected: PASS. To capture the red→green proof required by the lane deliverable, ALSO run the RED demonstration against a pre-fix binary built from the base commit. NOTE: do NOT try `git stash` for this — by this point the Task 2–4 fixes are COMMITTED, so there is nothing under `crates/` to stash; a stash would be a no-op, the rebuild would produce the FIXED binary, and the run would pass where a FAIL is expected. Build the base-commit server in a throwaway worktree instead:
```bash
git worktree add /tmp/p114-prefix bf6242a1
(cd /tmp/p114-prefix && cargo build --release -p freshell-server)
FRESHELL_E2E_RUST_SERVER_BIN=/tmp/p114-prefix/target/release/freshell-server \
  npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -15
git worktree remove /tmp/p114-prefix
```
Expected: FAIL on the pre-fix (`bf6242a1`) binary — validated deterministic symptom: the `data-has-tab='true'` wait times out (no arming → no adoption → never green); a green `terminal:<id>` ghost row may ALSO appear (client Phase-E on the unstamped feed). Record the exact symptom observed plus both run outcomes (this is the e2e red→green proof). Attribution note for the report: this scenario's red→green primarily proves Task 4 (arming) and Task 2 (feed stamping); Task 3 is evidenced by the no-reload constraint, not by row collapse.

### Task 6: E2E pinning — scenario 2: REST-created tabs are green and dedupe (case b, Incident 4)

The literal Incident-4 re-verification: a tab created via the REST agent API with a resume id must render green (`data-has-tab="true"`), and clicking its sidebar row must focus the existing pane, not open a duplicate. Claude and codex variants (amplifier is already pinned by `remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts`, which is re-run in Task 9).

**Files:**
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts`
- Contingency only (owned files): `src/lib/session-utils.ts`, `src/store/selectors/sidebarSelectors.ts` + their unit tests

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 5's scaffold (`server`, `info`, `bootAndConnect`, `SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID`, `PROJECT_DIR`, seeded claude JSONL); harness helpers `waitForTabCount`/`getTabCount` (donor usage: `remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts:253` dedupe assertion).
- Produces: scenario `case-b: REST-created resume tabs are green and dedupe on click`; a seeded codex rollout under the server HOME (constant `SEEDED_CODEX_THREAD_ID`) that Task 7 also asserts on.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the scenario (pinning test)**

Add to the serial suite, after case-c. Seed a codex rollout at runtime (VALIDATED: the index TTL is 1s — `directory_index.rs:50` — and every sweep re-discovers NEW files, pinned by the `new_file_added` test; allow ~2-4s worst-case stale-while-revalidate visibility in waits; donor shape: `sidebar-click-resume.spec.ts` ~`:175-185`):

```ts
const SEEDED_CODEX_THREAD_ID = randomUUID()

async function seedCodexRollout(homeDir: string, threadId: string, cwd: string): Promise<void> {
  // Donor shape: sidebar-click-resume.spec.ts ~:175-185 -- verify field
  // names (session_meta payload.id/payload.cwd + a message record) there.
  // VALIDATED: the cwd field is mandatory -- a rollout that does not parse
  // with a cwd is excluded from the index (R10b) and will NEVER appear.
  const day = '2026/07/20'
  const dir = path.join(homeDir, '.codex', 'sessions', day)
  await fs.mkdir(dir, { recursive: true })
  const lines = [
    JSON.stringify({ timestamp: '2026-07-20T08:00:00.000Z', type: 'session_meta', payload: { id: threadId, cwd } }),
    JSON.stringify({ timestamp: '2026-07-20T08:00:01.000Z', type: 'response_item', payload: { type: 'message', role: 'user', content: [{ type: 'input_text', text: 'P114 seeded codex session' }] } }),
  ]
  await fs.writeFile(path.join(dir, `rollout-2026-07-20T08-00-00-${threadId}.jsonl`), lines.join('\n') + '\n')
}

test('case-b: REST-created resume tabs are green and dedupe on click', async ({ page }) => {
  const harness = await bootAndConnect(page, info) // keep the TestHarness -- the dedupe gate below needs it
  await seedCodexRollout(info.homeDir, SEEDED_CODEX_THREAD_ID, PROJECT_DIR)

  for (const [mode, sessionId] of [
    ['claude', SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID],
    ['codex', SEEDED_CODEX_THREAD_ID],
  ] as const) {
    const res = await page.request.post(`${info.baseUrl}/api/tabs`, {
      headers: { 'x-auth-token': info.token, 'content-type': 'application/json' },
      // VALIDATED: raw codex resumeSessionId is deliberately 400-rejected at
      // HEAD (terminal_tabs.rs:124-131, pinned by

    })
    expect(res.ok()).toBe(true)

    const row = page.locator(`[data-session-id="${sessionId}"][data-provider="${mode}"]`)
    // Incident-4 contract: the row exists and is GREEN, not grey.
    await expect(row).toHaveAttribute('data-has-tab', 'true', { timeout: 30_000 })
    await expect(row).toHaveCount(1)

    // Dedupe contract: clicking the green row focuses the existing pane
    // instead of opening a second tab (donor: remote-tab-linkage:252-255).
    // getTabCount() is a NODE-SIDE TestHarness method
    // (helpers/test-harness.ts:150-155) that reads
    // window.__FRESHELL_TEST_HARNESS__?.getState() inside the page. The
    // window global itself has NO getTabCount method (src/lib/test-harness.ts
    // exposes getState/dispatch/getWsReadyState/...), so never call
    // getTabCount via page.evaluate -- that throws on every run.
    // Fail-loud guard: getTabCount() returns 0 when the harness is missing,
    // so pin tabsBefore > 0 (this loop just created tabs) to make a vacuous
    // 0 === 0 pass impossible.
    const tabsBefore = await harness.getTabCount()
    expect(tabsBefore).toBeGreaterThan(0)
    await row.click()
    await page.waitForTimeout(500)
    const tabsAfter = await harness.getTabCount()
    expect(tabsAfter).toBe(tabsBefore)
  }
})
```
(Copy the exact harness access idiom from the donor — `remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts:252-255` calls `await harness.getTabCount()` on the `TestHarness` instance `bootAndConnect` returns — and keep it fail-loud: never add a `?? <sentinel>` fallback around the calls, and keep the `tabsBefore > 0` pin, because a missing harness would otherwise make before/after equal (both 0) and the dedupe gate would pass without checking anything.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it**

```bash
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -20
```
Expected: PASS (the Incident-4 fix chain — `terminal_tabs.rs` sessionRef synthesis + the session-utils extractor — landed in earlier waves; this pins it). A pinning test passing immediately is the desired verification outcome here — record PASS.

- [ ] **Step 3: CONTINGENCY — only if a case-b assertion fails**

Diagnose which side guessed:
1. Row missing/grey for claude: inspect the created pane's content in the harness (`getPaneLayout`) — if `sessionRef` is absent and only `resumeSessionId` is present, the REST synthesis regressed. That is server territory (`terminal_tabs.rs`, touched in Task 4) — fix there with a unit test mirroring `create_amplifier_tab_with_legacy_resume_synthesizes_session_ref` for the failing mode.
2. Row grey though the pane HAS `sessionRef`: client join bug in owned code. Write a RED unit test in `test/unit/client/lib/session-utils.test.ts` (donor block `:125` `collectSessionLocatorsFromTabs`) reproducing the exact pane content observed, then fix `extractSessionLocators` (`src/lib/session-utils.ts:107` priority list) so the canonical `sessionRef` wins — never add client-side guessing (no matchScore/cwd heuristics; §4.2: client claims are proposals, the server-written `sessionRef` is the adopted truth).
3. Duplicate tab on click: `findPaneForSession` (`session-utils.ts:376`) scoring — same RED-unit-test-first discipline, donor tests at `session-utils.test.ts:216/301`.
Record whichever branch ran (or "none needed") in the Verification Report.

### Task 7: E2E pinning — scenario 3: joins survive a server restart (case a)

After a graceful restart (same home/port/token — the deploy-cycle shape), the reconnected client's sidebar must show the same sessions green with no duplicates: reconcile re-attaches the panes and the identity registry repopulates at respawn (VALIDATED: the client opts into `paneReconcileV1` unconditionally — `ws-client.ts:360` — respawn verdicts carry provider-correct sessionRef including codex — `reconcile.rs:286-290` — and the WS create re-upserts identity + ledger binding — `terminal.rs:1905-1950`). Validated caveats: re-POSTing a resume tab for a session whose earlier terminal is still alive is NOT rejected (`TerminalRegistry::create` spawns unconditionally; duplicates only ERROR-log via `alarm_if_duplicate_session_ref`) — expect that ERROR log line on the shared serial server, it is not a failure; the codex leg must use the `sessionRef` body shape, as in Task 6.

**Files:**
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 6's state (open claude + codex resume tabs from case-b, plus case-c's fresh codex pane); `server.restart()` (`rust-server.ts:322`); reconnect-wait idiom from `server-restart-recovery.spec.ts:106-111` (`getWsReadyState() === 'ready'` poll — copy the exact harness call). NOTE (validated): `server-restart-recovery.spec.ts` is shell-only legacy recreate — the resume-respawn precedent to consult for expectations is `reconcile-client-adoption-rust.spec.ts:293-383` (post-restart `claude --resume`).
- Produces: scenario `case-a: sidebar joins survive a graceful server restart`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the scenario (pinning test)**

```ts
test('case-a: sidebar joins survive a graceful server restart', async ({ page }) => {
  await bootAndConnect(page, info)
  // Panes from case-b/case-c are still open in this serial suite's page state?
  // No -- each test gets a fresh page. Re-establish: open both resume tabs.
  for (const [mode, sessionId] of [
    ['claude', SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID],
    ['codex', SEEDED_CODEX_THREAD_ID],
  ] as const) {
    const res = await page.request.post(`${info.baseUrl}/api/tabs`, {
      headers: { 'x-auth-token': info.token, 'content-type': 'application/json' },
      // VALIDATED: raw codex resumeSessionId is deliberately 400-rejected at
      // HEAD (terminal_tabs.rs:124-131, pinned by
      // create_codex_tab_rejects_raw_resume_session_id_without_session_ref);
      // the canonical sessionRef shape IS accepted (pinned by
      // create_codex_tab_accepts_session_ref_and_derives_resume_args). Do NOT
      // "fix" the rejection — use the canonical shape for codex.
      data: mode === 'codex'
        ? { mode, cwd: PROJECT_DIR, sessionRef: { provider: 'codex', sessionId } }
        : { mode, cwd: PROJECT_DIR, resumeSessionId: sessionId },
    })
    expect(res.ok()).toBe(true)
    await expect(page.locator(`[data-session-id="${sessionId}"][data-provider="${mode}"]`))
      .toHaveAttribute('data-has-tab', 'true', { timeout: 30_000 })
  }

  // Persist the layout before the restart (donor VERBATIM:
  // remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts:277-281). The dispatch goes through the
  // window harness global __FRESHELL_TEST_HARNESS__ -- there is NO
  // __freshellStore global anywhere in src/ or test/. The layout assertion
  // immediately after makes the flush observable: if the harness were
  // missing and the dispatch silently no-opped, persistedLayout would be
  // null and this fails loudly instead of riding on debounced persist timing.
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    (window as any).__FRESHELL_TEST_HARNESS__?.dispatch({ type: 'persist/flushNow' })
  })
  const persistedLayout = await page.evaluate(() => localStorage.getItem('freshell.layout.v3'))
  expect(persistedLayout, 'persisted layout must exist after flush').toBeTruthy()

  // Snapshot the --resume count BEFORE the restart. The argv log is shared
  // across the whole serial suite (case-b already resumed SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID
  // once, and this test's own pre-restart create adds another), so any
  // absolute threshold is satisfied before the restart even happens and
  // would pass vacuously. Only a before/after increase proves the respawn.
  const countResumes = (entries: Array<{ argv: string[] }>) =>
    entries.filter((e) => {
      const i = e.argv.indexOf('--resume')
      return i !== -1 && e.argv[i + 1] === SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID
    }).length
  const resumesBefore = countResumes(await readArgvLog(path.join(sharedRoot, 'claude-argv.jsonl')))

  await server.restart()
  await page.reload({ waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' })
  // reconnect wait: copy the exact idiom from server-restart-recovery.spec.ts:106-111

  // THE CONTRACT: every session is green again, exactly once.
  for (const [mode, sessionId] of [
    ['claude', SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID],
    ['codex', SEEDED_CODEX_THREAD_ID],
  ] as const) {
    const row = page.locator(`[data-session-id="${sessionId}"][data-provider="${mode}"]`)
    await expect(row).toHaveAttribute('data-has-tab', 'true', { timeout: 45_000 })
    await expect(row).toHaveCount(1)
  }
  // No provisional ghosts left over from respawned terminals.
  await expect(page.locator('[data-provider="codex"][data-session-id^="terminal:"]')).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 45_000 })

  // Respawn proof: the fake claude CLI was relaunched with --resume AFTER the
  // restart -- assert the count INCREASED relative to the pre-restart
  // snapshot (an absolute >=N threshold would already be met pre-restart and
  // prove nothing about the respawn).
  const resumesAfter = countResumes(await readArgvLog(path.join(sharedRoot, 'claude-argv.jsonl')))
  expect(resumesAfter).toBeGreaterThan(resumesBefore)
})
```
(Use the store/persist access idiom the donor actually uses at `remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts:277-285` — copy verbatim.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it**

```bash
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -20
```
Expected: PASS (reconcile handshake + ledger landed in waves A/B; Tasks 2–3 close the sidebar-visibility seams). If the green-again assertion times out, capture `GET /api/session-directory` (with the auth header) and the harness pane layout into the report BEFORE fixing; the likely seams, in order: (1) sweep didn't push after identity repopulation (Task 3 regression), (2) `join_running_state` missed a ledger-resolved identity (Task 2), (3) reconcile didn't re-attach (Lane C2 territory — if so, record the evidence, do NOT fix reconcile internals here; assert the sidebar contract against whatever reconcile verdict is produced and flag the cross-lane dependency in the report as a FAIL with evidence for the campaign to route).

```

### Task 8: E2E pinning — scenario 4: joins correct after recover-my-panes (case d)

After an abrupt restart with lost client layout, the user runs the recover-my-panes flow; recovered panes must join green in the sidebar. This drives the EXISTING recovery UI only (Lane C2 owns its internals — we assert the sidebar contract around it). (Validated: the REST-created pane's synthesized sessionRef reaches the tabs-snapshot and `build_inventory` has no per-pane identity filter — the pane is recoverable PROVIDED the requesting client is not filtered as its own creator; see the sessionStorage note in Step 1.)

**Files:**
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `server.restartAbrupt()` (`rust-server.ts:344`); the recovery-flow choreography from `test/e2e-browser/specs/recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts` (localStorage clearing, recovery offer/accept selectors, disk-settle waits — copy the exact helper blocks it uses; it is the canonical donor at `:43` onward); the claude row from `SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID`.
- Produces: scenario `case-d: recovered panes join green in the sidebar`; completes the four-case pinning matrix.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the scenario (pinning test)**

Keep this scenario LAST in the serial suite (it destroys local layout). Skeleton — lift the recovery choreography verbatim from the donor:

```ts
test('case-d: recovered panes join green in the sidebar', async ({ page }) => {
  await bootAndConnect(page, info)

  // Open a claude resume pane so there is something to lose + recover.
  const res = await page.request.post(`${info.baseUrl}/api/tabs`, {
    headers: { 'x-auth-token': info.token, 'content-type': 'application/json' },
    data: { mode: 'claude', cwd: PROJECT_DIR, resumeSessionId: SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID },
  })
  expect(res.ok()).toBe(true)
  await expect(page.locator(`[data-session-id="${SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID}"][data-provider="claude"]`))
    .toHaveAttribute('data-has-tab', 'true', { timeout: 30_000 })

  // [copy from recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts: wait for the ledger/snapshot
  //  disk writes to settle before the kill -- its exact wait helper]

  await server.restartAbrupt()

  // Lost-client simulation + recovery acceptance:
  // [copy from recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts: clear the freshell.layout.*
  //  localStorage keys, reload, wait for the recovery offer UI, accept it,
  //  wait for panes to be recreated -- its exact selectors and waits]
  // VALIDATED REQUIREMENT: ALSO clear sessionStorage (or use a fresh browser
  // context): the clientInstanceId persists in sessionStorage
  // (tabRegistrySync.ts:42-92); if it survives, the server's self-pollution
  // filter (recovery_inventory.rs:30-33) drops this client's own generations
  // and NO recovery offer ever appears (the donor spec uses fresh contexts).

  // THE CONTRACT: the recovered session is green again, exactly once.
  const row = page.locator(`[data-session-id="${SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID}"][data-provider="claude"]`)
  await expect(row).toHaveAttribute('data-has-tab', 'true', { timeout: 45_000 })
  await expect(row).toHaveCount(1)
})
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the full spec**

```bash
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -20
```
Expected: all four scenarios PASS. If case-d's final assertion fails while the recovery flow itself visibly succeeded (panes exist, terminals running), the gap is the sidebar join for recovered panes: check whether the recovered pane content carries `sessionRef` (harness `getPaneLayout`). If it does and the row is still grey, that is owned client join code — follow Task 6 Step 3's contingency discipline. If the recovery flow itself fails, that is Lane C2 territory: record evidence as FAIL-with-evidence in the report, do not fix recovery internals.

- [ ] **Step 3: Record + commit**

Append to the Verification Report:
```markdown
### Case (d) recover-my-panes (Task 8)
- Recovered claude pane joins green: <PASS | detail>
```

```bash
git add test/e2e-browser/specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts docs/plans/2026-07-26-sidebar-registry-sync.md
git commit -m "test(e2e): pin sidebar joins after recover-my-panes recovery (P1.14 case d)"
```

---

### Task 9: Full verification, report completion, push

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/plans/2026-07-26-sidebar-registry-sync.md` (final Verification Report section)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above.
- Produces: the lane deliverable — pushed branch, completed verification report (which cases passed as-is, which needed fixes, what remains with justification), red→green proof references.

- [ ] **Step 1: Rust full gate**

```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/sidebar-registry-sync
df -h .   # halt on ENOSPC risk
cargo test --workspace 2>&1 | tail -10
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings 2>&1 | tail -5
```
Expected: PASS / zero warnings.

- [ ] **Step 2: Coordinated vitest suite (gate-aware)**

```bash
npm run test:status
FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY="P1.14 sidebar-registry-sync full suite" npm test 2>&1 | tail -20
```
Expected: PASS. WAIT for the gate if held (2 sibling lanes are running).

- [ ] **Step 3: Affected existing e2e re-runs (regression net for the touched seams)**

```bash
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium \
  specs/sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts \
  specs/remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts \
  specs/server-restart-recovery.spec.ts \
  specs/recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts \
  specs/sidebar-click-resume.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -20
```
Expected: all PASS. (These cover the amplifier Incident-4 variant, the generic restart skeleton, the recovery flow this plan asserts around, and sidebar click-resume.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Complete the Verification Report**

Finalize the `## Verification Report` section so it answers the spec's deliverable directly:
- Table of the four contract cases → PASS-as-is / FIXED (with commit shas) / FAIL-with-evidence (cross-lane, routed).
- The fixes list: identity-registry stamping of the `/api/terminals` projection (Task 2 — NOT a ledger-backed join; that premise was falsified during load-bearing validation), identity-aware sweep push (Task 3), REST codex arming (Task 4), plus any contingencies that fired.
- "What remains" with justification. Expected residuals to document honestly (both are outside this lane's contract cases, documented not deferred-from-scope): (1) tabs open ONLY in another client/device still render grey locally — `hasTab` means "open in THIS client"; the registry pane payload carries `sessionRef` (untyped) and a semantics decision (green vs a third state) is a user-facing design call the campaign must make; (2) REST-created terminal identities are never retired on exit (documented at `terminal_tabs.rs:839-853`, a crate-cycle constraint predating this lane); (3) the §4.2 rung-2 ledger fallback in the sidebar join has NO production window (validated this workflow: every Bound-row writer upserts the registry with the session id first; terminal ids are never re-minted across restarts) — the sidebar consults rung 1 only, deliberately; record this so future lanes don't re-plan it; (4) `paneReconcileFreshAgentV1` is shipped-but-dormant (the client never sends it) — fresh-agent verdict entries are inert; this lane's terminal-pane cases are unaffected. Also record the Task 4 scope interpretation and the Task 2 `terminals.rs` ownership interpretation (see Global Constraints) for the campaign owner.
- Red→green proof pointers: Task 2/3/4 RED steps + Task 5 Step 2's pre-fix binary run.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit + push, STOP before PR**

```bash
git add docs/plans/2026-07-26-sidebar-registry-sync.md
git commit -m "docs(p1.14): complete sidebar-registry-sync verification report"
git push -u origin feat/sidebar-registry-sync
```
PR POLICY: NOT approved — do NOT run `gh pr create`. Final output: branch name, the Verification Report, and the red→green proof references.

---

## Verification Report

(Appended per task during execution. Baseline in Task 1; cases c/b/a/d in Tasks 2–8; final consolidation in Task 9.)

### Baseline (Task 1)
- Worktree feat/sidebar-registry-sync @ bf6242a1: clean.
- cargo test -p freshell-server session_directory: PASS (52 tests).
- cargo test -p freshell-freshagent: PASS.
- sidebarSelectors + SidebarItem.running-state vitest: PASS (39 tests).
- Disk headroom: 17G available.

### Case (c) join/ghost, server unit level (Task 2)
- VERIFIED FAILING then FIXED: /api/terminals sidebar projection hard-coded
  session_ref = None for codex; an adopted terminal's row now carries its
  registry session identity (rung 1), so the client Phase-E terminal:<id>
  ghost never materializes. RED proof: assertion-level (or compile-level if
  the seam was threaded), then green.
- Validated non-change: the rung-2 PaneLedger fallback in session_directory
  joins was evaluated and REJECTED (no production window; dormant-machinery
  risk). Existing rung-1 consultation already collapses post-adoption
  duplicates. Residual pinning test rewritten: pre-adoption duplicate is
  transient, not permanent.

### Case (c) push seam (Task 3)
- VERIFIED FAILING then FIXED: sweep signature was blind to identity
  adoption; now includes a (terminal_id, provider, session_id) digest.
  Adoption/open/close push sessions.changed within one 2s tick.

### Case (b)/(c) REST codex arming (Task 4)
- VERIFIED FAILING then FIXED: REST-created codex panes were never armed for
  B2 locator adoption. Now armed, mirroring amplifier/opencode.
- note_submit REST coverage: REST path added (before-write, is_submit_input-gated) (Step 5 outcome).

### Case (c) end-to-end (Task 5)
- Pinning e2e: fresh REST-created codex terminal collapses to ONE green row
  without reload. Result on fixed branch: PASS. Result on bf6242a1 server
  binary: FAIL (the 45s no-reload wait timed out with the single codex row
  still carrying a client-minted `terminal:<id>` ghost session id --
  `expect(sessionId?.startsWith('terminal:')).toBe(false)` received `true`;
  no arming -> no adoption, the ghost never collapses to the real rollout
  id) -- red->green proven.

### Case (b) REST-created tabs / Incident 4 (Task 6)
- claude REST resume tab: PASS as-is (row green, `data-has-tab="true"`, count 1).
- codex REST resume tab: PASS as-is (canonical sessionRef body; row green, count 1).
- click-dedupe: PASS (product behavior needed no fix; none of the brief's
  contingency branches fired). One test-side suite-order fix was required:
  in full-suite order, case-c's panes persist in server memory, so case-b's
  fresh browser context raises RecoveryOfferPanel ("Restore 2 panes from
  server memory?") -- a fixed inset-0 z-[60] overlay that intercepted the
  sidebar row click and timed the test out (case-b passed standalone, where
  server memory is empty at boot). Fixed by declining the offer after
  bootAndConnect (donor idiom: recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts:377); recovery
  semantics themselves are case-d territory (Task 8). Full spec then green:
  2 passed (case-c + case-b), 1.1m.
- amplifier variant: covered by remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts (re-run in Task 9).

### Case (a) restart survival (Task 7)
- claude resume pane green after restart: PASS (`data-has-tab="true"` within the
  45s window after `server.restart()` + reload + WS-ready wait, row count
  exactly 1).
- codex resume pane green after restart: PASS (canonical sessionRef body on the
  re-POST; row green, count exactly 1).
- no provisional terminal:<id> ghosts: PASS (zero
  `[data-provider="codex"][data-session-id^="terminal:"]` rows post-restart).
- respawn proven via argv log: PASS via the before/after discipline -- the
  `--resume <SEEDED_CLAUDE_ID>` count in the shared claude-argv.jsonl strictly
  increased across the restart (an absolute threshold would already have been
  met pre-restart by case-b's resume plus this test's own pre-restart create,
  and would have passed vacuously).
- Test-side notes: recovery offer declined after boot (same suite-order overlay
  as case-b; server memory holds case-b/case-c panes); persist flush via
  `__FRESHELL_TEST_HARNESS__.dispatch({type:'persist/flushNow'})` with the
  fail-loud `persistedLayout` truthy assertion; reconnect wait copied verbatim
  from server-restart-recovery.spec.ts:106-111. Product needed no fix (pinning
  PASS on the first full-suite run; no Step-2 diagnostic branch fired). Full
  spec green in suite order: 3 passed (case-c + case-b + case-a), 1.6m.

### Case (d) recover-my-panes (Task 8)
- Recovered claude pane joins green: PASS (`data-has-tab="true"` within the
  45s window after `server.restartAbrupt()` + fresh-context boot + recovery
  offer ACCEPT, row count exactly 1). Product needed no fix (no contingency
  branch fired; recovery internals untouched -- Lane C2).
- Lost-client simulation: the boot context is closed WHOLE before the abrupt
  restart and the recovery runs in a FRESH browser context (donor idiom,
  recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts:290 + :236-246) -- empty localStorage AND
  empty sessionStorage, honoring the validated clientInstanceId requirement
  (tabRegistrySync.ts:42-92; recovery_inventory.rs:30-33 self-pollution
  filter would otherwise suppress the offer). Service workers blocked in the
  fresh context (donor :215-226 race).
- Decline-vs-accept: the PRE-restart boot declines the suite-order offer from
  earlier cases' server-memory panes (same overlay as case-b/case-a); the
  offer case-d ACCEPTS appears post-restart in the fresh context, whose empty
  storage the decline dismissal cannot touch.
- Disk-settle before the kill: ledger binding row + a snapshot generation
  needled on BOTH the sessionId AND this test's restTabId (sessionId alone
  matches earlier cases' stale generations -- vacuous wait).
- One test-side adaptation vs the donor: post-accept "panes recreated" gate is
  `.xterm` ATTACHED, not visible -- on this shared serial server the recovery
  set includes picker-bearing "New Tab" generations and the active tab after
  accept can be a picker while the recovered claude terminal mounts in a
  background tab (first full-suite run failed visible with the terminal
  mounted-but-hidden; TabContent kept alive per App.tsx:1611).
- Full spec green in suite order: 4 passed (case-c + case-b + case-a +
  case-d), 1.8m.

### Final consolidation (Task 9)

Execution note: Task 9 originally halted at the plan-mandated disk gate
(8.0G available < 10G threshold, disk 99% full). Resumed after the disk was
replaced (1005G available at re-verification). All gates re-run from
Task 9 Step 1 on the unchanged branch tip `51488999`.

#### Contract cases — spec deliverable

| Spec case | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| (a) restarts | PASS as-is (with Tasks 2–3 server fixes already on branch) | Task 7 e2e: claude + codex rows green post-restart, count 1, zero `terminal:<id>` ghosts, respawn proven via argv-count increase |
| (b) REST/MCP-created tabs (Incident 4) | PASS as-is (product); one test-side suite-order fix | Task 6 e2e: claude + codex REST resume tabs green, click-dedupe holds; amplifier variant re-run green via `remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts` (Task 9 Step 3) |
| (c) fresh codex duplicate | FIXED | `7be4a2d6` (identity-stamped `/api/terminals` projection), `d5a97167`+`b8b79cba` (identity digest in sweep signature), `8c37cfd6` (REST codex locator arming); pinned by `375e5f89` with red→green proof against a `bf6242a1` pre-fix server binary |
| (d) recover-my-panes | PASS as-is | Task 8 e2e: recovered claude pane joins green in a fresh browser context after `restartAbrupt()` + recovery ACCEPT |

#### The fixes list

1. `GET /api/terminals` sidebar projection stamps `session_ref` from the
   `TerminalIdentityRegistry` (authority rung 1) instead of hard-coding
   `None` for codex (`7be4a2d6`). NOT a ledger-backed join — the rung-2
   ledger-fallback premise was falsified during load-bearing validation.
2. `sessions_sweep_signature` includes a (terminal_id, provider,
   session_id) identity digest so locator adoptions push `sessions.changed`
   within one sweep tick (`d5a97167`, review follow-up `b8b79cba`).
3. REST `/api/tabs` create path arms the codex locator, mirroring
   amplifier/opencode; REST-path `note_submit` added before-write,
   `is_submit_input`-gated (`8c37cfd6`).
4. Contingencies: none of Task 6/8's product contingency branches fired.
   Client join machinery shipped unchanged, as the plan predicted.

#### Red→green proof pointers

- Task 2: unit-level RED on the unstamped projection, then green
  (terminals.rs test module).
- Task 3: sweep-signature RED (identity-blind digest), then green
  (main.rs sweep tests).
- Task 4: arming RED (codex pane never armed on REST path), then green
  (terminal_tabs.rs unit test).
- Task 5 Step 2: binary red→green — the case-c e2e FAILS against a
  `bf6242a1` pre-fix server binary (45s no-reload wait times out with the
  client-minted `terminal:<id>` ghost still present) and PASSES on the
  fixed branch.

#### Final gate results (Task 9, post-disk-fix re-run)

- `cargo fmt --check`: clean.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`: zero warnings.
- `cargo test --workspace`: 1913 passed, 0 failed (75 suites). One
  pre-existing intermittent failure observed during repeated runs — see
  "What remains" item 5.
- Coordinated `npm test` (full suite, gate acquired + released cleanly):
  client 4156 passed | 8 skipped (390 files | 3 skipped), server 4548
  passed | 16 skipped (296 files | 3 skipped), electron 350 passed
  (34 files), exit 0.
- `cargo build --release -p freshell-server`: success.
- Playwright `rust-chromium` regression net (Task 9 Step 3): 11/11 passed
  (1.9m) across `sidebar-registry-sync-rust.spec.ts` (4),
  `remote-tab-linkage-rust.spec.ts`, `server-restart-recovery.spec.ts`,
  `recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts`, `sidebar-click-resume.spec.ts`.

#### Scope interpretations for the campaign owner

- Task 2 (`terminals.rs`): treated as lane-owned — the sidebar's
  terminal-directory feed projection is the contract seam this lane exists
  to fix; the change is a registry READ (authority rung 1). Not on the
  forbidden list.
- Task 4 (`crates/freshell-freshagent` codex-locator arming): the
  lane-spec exception text ("is it now fixable with locator identity? If
  yes, fix it") could not be located in a persisted document (unpersisted
  pipeline prompt). Interpretation applied: `arm()` adds no new ledger
  writer (the shared locator sweep remains the single pre-existing
  writer), and sanctioned campaign work already touched REST-path
  freshagent binding behavior (B4 fast-follow `2b3b4fa9`). Overrule at
  review if this reading is wrong.

#### What remains (documented honestly, with justification)

1. Tabs open ONLY in another client/device still render grey locally —
   `hasTab` means "open in THIS client". The registry pane payload carries
   `sessionRef` (untyped); green-vs-third-state semantics is a user-facing
   design call for the campaign, outside this lane's contract cases.
2. REST-created terminal identities are never retired on exit
   (`terminal_tabs.rs:839-853`, crate-cycle constraint predating this
   lane).
3. The §4.2 rung-2 ledger fallback in the sidebar join has NO production
   window (validated this workflow: every Bound-row writer upserts the
   registry with the session id first; terminal ids are never re-minted
   across restarts). The sidebar consults rung 1 only, deliberately —
   recorded so future lanes don't re-plan it.
4. `paneReconcileFreshAgentV1` is shipped-but-dormant (the client never
   sends it); fresh-agent verdict entries are inert. This lane's
   terminal-pane cases are unaffected.
5. Pre-existing flake (cross-lane, NOT touched by this branch):
   `freshell-ws pane_ledger::tests::new_locked_degrades_to_disabled_when_another_holder_exists`
   (`pane_ledger_tests.rs:163`, "flock freed on drop") failed twice during
   repeated `cargo test --workspace` runs in one ~12-minute window, then
   could not be reproduced across 21 consecutive full-workspace runs plus
   22 targeted freshell-ws runs (peak fd usage measured at 143, ruling
   out fd exhaustion at the default ulimit; an instrumented reproduction
   loop never fired). The test file is unchanged from `origin/main`
   (P1.13, `5745022d`). Mechanism unproven; left unfixed rather than
   masked with a retry, because if the flake is real its production shape
   is "a restarted server comes up with the pane ledger silently
   DISABLED" — that deserves a P1.13-owner investigation, not a
   test-side band-aid. One additional workspace run in the same
   investigation failed (exit 101) in a test OTHER than the pane_ledger
   one; its output was not preserved and 18 subsequent logged runs were
   green.
