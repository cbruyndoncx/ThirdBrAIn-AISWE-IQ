# DIAG-01 — Structured JSONL Rust server/Tauri logs — Evidence

Worker: `df1-diag-01-jsonl-logs` · Branch: `df1/diag-01-jsonl-logs` (base `origin/df1/integration` @ `3dbba43c2`) · Plan: `docs/plans/df1/DIAG-01.md`

## Verdict

**Rust-server side: COMPLETE.** Every JSONL line carries the full DIAG-01 required set — timestamp, severity, component/event, request/connection/process ownership, app version, lifecycle context — proven black-box against the compiled binary through the checklist's named flows (auth, terminal, provider, recoverable error, restart, quit). Tauri-side producers are host-limited (dispatch-sanctioned); the schema is documented as a Tauri-ready contract.

## What the base already had (credit where due)

- `d5a526d3` — `crates/freshell-server/src/logging.rs`: JsonLayer (`ts`/`level`/`target`/`msg` + flattened fields), rotation, from-first-byte redaction, HTTP request middleware (`request_id`/`route`/`method`/`status`/`duration_ms`).
- `c200a656c` — WS (`ws.connection.established/closed/hello.rejected/keepalive.terminated`), terminal (`terminal.created/exited/killed/idle_reap`), freshagent-codex lifecycle events as event-level fields.
- `shutdown_forensics` record at signal receipt.

## Gaps closed by this branch

1. **App version was absent from log output entirely** → `app_version` now stamped on every line by the JsonLayer (resolved once at boot: `FRESHELL_APP_VERSION` env → `APP_VERSION` const; cross-checked against `GET /api/version`'s `currentVersion` in the black-box test). (commit `5cea64611`)
2. **Process ownership per line** → `server_pid` stamped on every line next to `app_version` (child processes keep their own `pid` fields on spawn events — no collision by name). (commit `5cea64611`)
3. **Connection ownership existed only on two lifecycle events** → `run()` now wraps the whole serve loop (extracted `run_loop`) in a per-connection `ws_conn` span (`connection_id` + `origin_kind`); all 15 fresh-agent `tokio::spawn` sites in the dispatch are `.instrument(Span::current())`'d, the gated restore-create task too, and all 16 `spawn_blocking` sites in `terminal.rs` go through `spawn_blocking_in_span` (span context would otherwise be dropped at BOTH thread/task boundaries — this is what puts `connection_id` on the registry's `terminal.created`, which fires from a blocking-pool PTY spawn). (commit `f787178fa`)
4. **No server lifecycle context** → `server.started` (`bind`,`port`,`boot_id`,`instance_id`,`commit`,`dirty`), `server.stopping` (`signal`), `server.stopped` (after every shutdown owner; on disk by construction — synchronous per-line flush). `boot_id` wiring into `WsState` became a clone so the event names the same boot the WS handshake reports. (commit `3ceb699df`)
5. **Stale module doc** claiming WS/terminal wiring out of scope → rewritten as the canonical schema contract. (commit `3ceb699df`)
6. **Review-round-1 fix**: `ws_conn` span was INFO-level → silently disabled by an operator's `RUST_LOG=warn`/`error`, stripping `connection_id` from exactly the WARN/ERROR in-connection events an operator cranks the filter up to inspect (empirically confirmed: empty span-field set under a warn EnvFilter). Span now minted at ERROR level via one production constructor `connection_span` (context infrastructure; JsonLayer never renders span open/close so zero output effect), pinned by a five-level filter matrix unit test with an INFO-flip negative control. (commit `effa0421d`)
7. **Review-round-1 fix (doc)**: plan flow list closed the WS then reused it; corrected to one socket across steps 2–4. (commit `effa0421d`)

## Tauri-readiness note (host-limited producers)

The canonical schema is documented in `crates/freshell-server/src/logging.rs`'s module header ("Canonical line schema (the Tauri-ready contract)"). It is deliberately free of server-only assumptions: a Tauri host producer emits the same shape with its own `app_version` and its process's pid, and the streams merge coherently. Implementing the Tauri-side producer requires the native Windows/macOS Tauri host (`PW-TAURI-WIN`/HARNESS-07), unavailable on this Linux host per the dispatch brief; nothing in this branch blocks it.

## Playwright decision (dispatch: "prefer rust crate/integration tests, record decision")

No Playwright spec was authored. Rationale: DIAG-01's assertion surface is a server-side file artifact. The black-box Rust integration test (`crates/freshell-server/tests/diag01_lifecycle_logging.rs`) boots the REAL compiled binary and drives REAL HTTP + WS + SIGTERM with deterministic `HOME`/`FRESHELL_HOME` temp isolation — strictly more direct than a browser-mediated run of the same flows, and it can drive SIGTERM/restart, which a browser cannot. The checklist's named flows (auth, terminal, provider, recoverable error, restart, quit) are all exercised there. `PW-TAURI-WIN` remains blocked on the native Tauri host regardless of test framework.

## Green commands (final HEAD)

All run under the df1 cargo lease (`acquire.sh cargo df1-diag-01-jsonl-logs`):

- `cargo test -p freshell-server --test diag01_lifecycle_logging` — 2/2 passed (×3 runs)
- `cargo test -p freshell-server --test diag01_diag03_logging` — 1/1 passed
- `cargo test -p freshell-server` — full crate: 609 unit + all integration files green
- `cargo test -p freshell-ws --lib` — 433 passed, 0 failed (includes the new span/dedupe tests)
- `cargo test -p freshell-ws` — every binary green EXCEPT `tests/auto_resume_e2e.rs`, which flakes on this host at 10s frame-wait timeouts; attribution-tested against virgin base (fails there at the same-or-worse rate) = PRE-EXISTING, not caused by this branch — see "Known-flaky exclusion" below
- `cargo test -p freshell-terminal` — 175+ green
- `cargo test -p freshell-freshagent` — 358+ green (incl. the extended diag01 capture test)
- `cargo clippy -p freshell-server -p freshell-ws -p freshell-freshagent --all-targets -- -D warnings` — clean
- `cargo fmt --check -p freshell-server -p freshell-ws -p freshell-freshagent` — clean

## Precise waiter-window note (review round 4 finding, dispositioned)

`CreateDedupe` purposefully answers a cross-connection duplicate arriving during an *adopt* / *session-ref-attach* / *session-reserved* window with a fail-loud error (the origin settles nothing on those exits; the sentinel is dropped "on every other exit (adopt/session-reserved/sessionRef-attach/create failure, restore-gate shutdown)" — deliberate per the code's own design comments, predating this branch and untouched by it). On those windows the `ws.terminal.create.settled` event logs the ORIGIN's reply with `path="adopted"` / `"session_ref_attached"`; the waiting connection receives no `terminal.created` (by design, loud instead). Whether the adopt window should instead settle-and-forward is a create-lane semantics question, not a logging question — filed as `DIAG-FOLLOWUP-ADOPT-WAITER-SETTLE` for that lane's owner.

## Known-flaky exclusion (classified, attribution-tested)

`crates/freshell-ws --test auto_resume_e2e` (both tests) flakes on this host at 10s frame-wait timeouts. Attribution experiment: virgin `origin/df1/integration` in a scratch worktree fails **3/6 isolated runs (50%)** once `node_modules` exists (without it: 100%, because claude-mode MCP injection resolves `node_modules/tsx`/`dist/server/mcp/server.js` relative to repo root — also a fail-loud gap); this branch: 4/17 (~24%). Same failure on both → pre-existing, NOT caused by DIAG-01. Filed as `DIAG-FOLLOWUP-AUTORESUME-FLAKE`.

## Review loop record

1. Preferred path (fresh subagent via freshell fresh-agent pane) attempted twice; the environment's MCP gateway timed out / returned phantom tab ids → fell back to the dispatch-sanctioned recorded fresh-eyes review.
2. Round 1 (fresheyes `--gpt`, FRESHPID 236685): 2 findings — (a) INFO-level ws_conn span drops connection_id under `RUST_LOG=warn+` (empirically confirmed, fixed with ERROR-level `connection_span` + 5-level filter test + negative control); (b) plan-doc WS close/reuse contradiction (fixed). Commit `effa0421d`.
3. Round 2 (FRESHPID 2576086): 5 findings — (a) target-directive filters: probed the real span-enablement matrix (bare levels + globally-anchored mixes keep spans; target-directive-only mixes kill span callsites outright, even matched-target ones) → systemic dual-carrier fix (`ws.terminal.create.settled` event-field join from all four reply paths) + honest guarantee-envelope test + schema doc; (b) plan Task-2 code still showed `info_span!` → fixed; (c) evidence-untracked (stale mid-review read; already committed) → no-op; (d) plan run-steps missing lease wrapper note → fixed; (e) ambient `FRESHELL_APP_VERSION` could poison the restart test → `env_remove` added. Commit `6bc8cb371`.
4. Round 3 (FRESHPID 4076954): 2 findings — (a) cross-connection in-flight duplicate waiters answered via bare FrameSink: no join could name the waiter's connection → waiters now carry `conn_id` through `CreateDedupe` and `settle()` emits one `ws.terminal.create.settled` (path `duplicate_in_flight_waiter`) per waiter (RED first: frame forwarded, no event); (b) schema overclaimed `freshagent.sidecar.spawned` fields → event now carries static `provider` + `pid`, doc spells out the pid↔session adjacent-event join, black-box test asserts both. Commit `832f575f5`.
5. Round 4 (FRESHPID 2661566): 4 findings — (a) adopt/session-ref windows never settle dedupe (waiters get fail-loud error): verified DELIBERATE pre-existing semantics (documented in the dispatch's own comment, predates this branch); dispositioned as precise documentation + filed `DIAG-FOLLOWUP-ADOPT-WAITER-SETTLE` for the create lane (delivery semantics out of a logging item's scope); (b) `crash_detected` lacked `provider` → provider swept onto all freshagent session lifecycle events (incl. `send.accepted`, `turn.complete`, `crash_recovery.*`), in-crate test extended (RED first); (c) plan Produces line stale → fixed; (d) evidence wording now carries the flake exception in-sentence. Commit `6d241f4ff`.
6. Round 5 (FRESHPID 4060204): 3 findings — (a) `crash_recovery.minted_new` lacked canonical `session_id` → added (new current thread) beside the old/new forensics pair; (b) black-box boot didn't clear `FRESHELL_LOG_DIR`/`MAX_BYTES`/`MAX_BACKUPS` → `env_remove` all three; (c) `ws.connection.closed` relied on span-only `origin_kind` → now an event field (proven via the capture layer's new event-only `event_fields` view; RED via that view). Commit `30b1388e9`.
7. Post-round-5 structured self-review (recorded; loop capped at 5): re-read the full final diff (`git diff origin/df1/integration...HEAD`) finding: no further qualifying defects; dispositions consistent; schema doc matches code (spot-checked every documented field against its producer site: `terminal.killed` by/api-idle-shutdown ✓, `shutdown_forensics` event field ✓, settle-companion fields ✓). One observed-transient disclosure: one freshell-freshagent lib test failed exactly once during the r5 verification window (name not captured); 7/7 full-suite reruns immediately after were green, and the r5 diff does not touch timing logic — classified unclassified-transient, noting here for the verifier.

Final HEAD fully green: freshell-ws 44/44 binaries (including auto_resume_e2e), freshell-server, freshell-terminal, freshell-freshagent (358), clippy `-D warnings` clean, fmt clean.
