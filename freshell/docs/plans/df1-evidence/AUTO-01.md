# AUTO-01 evidence — `ui.layout.sync` authoritative

**Item (verbatim):** "Make `ui.layout.sync` authoritative. Replace the OpenCode-only
shadow layout with the real connected UI layout shared by browser, REST, CLI, and MCP.
Reverse mutations are owned by `AUTO-02` through `AUTO-11`."

**Plan:** `docs/plans/df1/AUTO-01.md` (parity anchors + load-bearing ledger, 10/10
claims verified inline before execution; residual risks R1–R5 recorded there).
**Worker:** `df1-auto-01-layout-sync-auth`. Base: `origin/df1/integration` (3dbba43c2).

## What landed (branch `df1/auto-01-layout-sync-auth`)

1. **`crates/freshell-freshagent/src/layout_store.rs`** — Rust port of legacy
   `server/agent-api/layout-store.ts`: whole-snapshot last-write-wins ingest
   (`updateFromUi`), the six-key/empty/filtered snapshot shapes EXACTLY (incl.
   `timestamp`-when-fed), `listTabs`/`listPanes` (legacy tab resolution
   `?tabId || activeTabId || tabs[0]`, tree-order leaves, title fallback),
   derived pane-title seeding (`derivePaneTitle` port), `has_tab` (id OR title),
   `getPaneSnapshot`/`resolvePaneToTerminal`/`findPaneByTerminalId`/
   `findSplitForPane`/`getSplitSizes`, and the mutation ops the existing Rust
   routes need (`createTab`/`splitPane`/`closePane` incl. the legacy
   buildGridLayout rebuild/last-pane guard, `selectTab`/`selectPane`,
   `renameTab`/`renamePane` cascades, `closeTab`, `swapPane` incl. title travel,
   `resizePane`, `attachPaneContent`). Plus an exact port of
   `shared/fresh-agent.ts`'s `migrateLegacyFreshAgentContent/Node`
   normalization (canonical-claude-id check hand-rolled; hand-verified table).
2. **WS ingestion**: `ClientMessage::UiLayoutSync` arm in
   `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs` (`handle_client_text`) feeding the store
   (never replies, per legacy). `FreshAgentState.layout_store` +
   `FreshOpencodeState::fresh_agent()` accessors — zero new crate edges
   (`freshell-ws` already depends on `freshell-freshagent`; `main.rs` already
   shares ONE instance between WS and REST).
3. **Reads re-pointed at the store**: `GET /api/layout/snapshot` (real tree;
   the fabricated `{type:'unknown',paneIds}` marker deleted), `GET /api/tabs`
   (ordered, real `activeTabId`, legacy-exact `{id,title,activePaneId}` rows),
   `GET /api/panes` (legacy tab resolution + tree order + seeded titles;
   additive `tabId` KEPT — one recorded deviation), `GET /api/tabs/has`
   (title arm restored, legacy-exact). The shadow `tabs`/`TabRecord` map was
   REMOVED entirely (its last uses were the pre-AUTO-01 read surface).
4. **Write-through at existing mutation routes** (route contracts unchanged —
   broadcasts, statuses, rollback all AUTO-02…11-owned): `POST /api/tabs`
   (fresh-agent + terminal + browser/editor; written AFTER spawn success — no
   rollback window, unlike legacy's create-first + catch-closeTab, recorded),
   `split_pane` (legacy two-step: placeholder then `attachPaneContent`),
   `close_pane`/`select_pane`/`select_tab`/`rename_tab`/`delete_tab` (resolve or
   mutate through the store), `swap_pane`/`navigate_pane`/`respawn_pane`
   (write-through alongside the kept dispatch shadow maps
   `terminal_panes`/`content_panes`/`pane_tabs` — those REMAIN the
   send/capture/wait-for resolution source until AUTO-09, see R4),
   `retire_restore_key_content` closes the store tab.
5. **Honest deferral text updates** (state now exists; route contracts still
   owned by AUTO-03/06): `tabs_next/prev`, `resize_pane`, `rename_pane`,
   `attach_pane` — all still 400/200-with-deviation, text states the truth.

## Deferred scope (recorded)

- R2: per-connection `sidebarOpenSessionKeys` rebuild — legacy stores it but NO
  production code reads it (only `test/server/ws-*` tests do). Not ported;
  flagged for AUTO-14-adjacent follow-up if ever needed.
- R4: send-keys/capture/wait-for still resolve via the pre-existing shadow maps
  (a mirror-only UI pane is not yet drivable); AUTO-09 owns that re-point.
- R3: malformed layouts — legacy zod rejects the whole frame; Rust
  accept-and-strip stores with total normalization. Bounded divergence, documented.

## Tests (TDD evidence)

- `layout_store_tests.rs`: 41 unit tests (snapshot shapes, last-write-wins,
  detached clones, migration table incl. nested splits/alias/sessionRef rules,
  deriveTitle table, mutation ops incl. grid rebuild + title travel).
  RED observed (todo!/missing-API compile-fail + assertion failures) → GREEN.
- `crates/freshell-ws/tests/ui_layout_sync.rs`: 4 integration tests — real WS
  frame → store state (normalization + titles + source conn), last-write-wins
  across two connections with source tracking, never-replies, and a
  same-process WS→REST end-to-end (real axum REST server on the shared state;
  `/api/layout/snapshot` + `/api/panes` + `/api/tabs` read back the WS-fed
  layout). RED (2 ingest assertions failed pre-arm) → GREEN.
- Route tests in `pane_ops`/`terminal_tabs`: mirror-fed exact-tree snapshot,
  title-based `tabs/has`, legacy pane-list resolution/order, mirror-only pane
  close incl. last-pane guard, REST-create ordering/active-tab assertions —
  plus the two pre-AUTO-01 reduced-fidelity tests rewritten to the
  authoritative expectations (`unknown`-marker test → real split tree;
  `/api/tabs` rows legacy-exact).
- Full suites: `freshell-freshagent --lib` 400/400; `freshell-protocol` green;
  `freshell-ws` full (`--no-fail-fast`, `/tmp/auto01-ws-suite.log`) EXIT=0,
  45 binaries OK (one load-flake `auto_resume_e2e` timeout under swarm load,
  re-run green in isolation — unrelated to this change; discipline per
  df1 README B002).

## Playwright probe (`layout-sync-authoritative.spec.ts`, MATRIX-registered)

Two tests, both legs: (1) visible-UI-only create/rename/reorder/select/split/
resize/close, then `/api/layout/snapshot` must equal the client's real layout
(tabs order/IDs, exact trees incl. dragged ratios, titles, active tab/pane);
(2) raw legacy `agent-chat` sync frame → normalized server-side snapshot +
pane rows (legacy = true parity control).

Per-leg outcomes (probe rule: run once per relevant leg; classified):

- `legacy-chromium`: **GREEN**.
  - v1/v2 (2-worker): spec-side defects found by the probe and fixed —
    (a) `.xterm` locator matched HIDDEN terminals of the inactive tab
    (fixed with `:visible`); (b) an over-pinned resize assertion
    (`sizes[0] != 50`) — a 50px drag leaves the divider at 50/50 on this
    surface (same as pane-system.spec.ts's own drag test, which never
    asserts sizes); the resize reflection stays covered by the exact
    client↔REST equality poll.
  - v3 (test 2 solo under `-g`, debugging a 2-worker timeout): PASS (40s).
    The v1/v2 test-2 timeout was load/parallelism, not a defect.
  - v4 (both tests, 2 workers, final spec): **PASS 2/2 (33.7s)**.
- `rust-chromium`: **GREEN**. First attempt 2/2 (1.6m incl. release rebuild)
  at `4d7dac7c5`; **re-probed at the final review-complete code (2/2, 51.1s,
  `/tmp/auto01-pw-rust-final.log`)** after the review-round Rust changes, so
  the probe covers the final state.
- Probe logs: `/tmp/auto01-pw-legacy4.log`, `/tmp/auto01-pw-rust.log`,
  `/tmp/auto01-pw-rust-final.log` (ephemeral; the MATRIX registration makes
  both legs re-runnable any time).

## Review loop (fresheyes independent reviews, GPT; Task tool unavailable in
this dispatch environment — the authorized fallback)

- **Round 1** (pid 3154216, verdict FAILED → fixed): (major) vacuous
  never-replies test → now reads the very next raw frame and asserts it IS the
  pong; (major) evidence lacked per-leg probe classification → the section
  above; (minor) `list_tabs` `""`-title fallback parity + regression test.
- **Round 2** (pid 3886807, verdict FAILED → fixed): (major) `split_pane`
  trusted stale `pane_tabs` and spawned PTYs before authoritative rejection —
  reordered to legacy's store-first shape (`router.ts:1305-1315`), with
  stale-shadow + mirror-only regression tests; `respawn_pane`/`navigate_pane`
  got the same store-first resolution.
- **Round 3** (pid 1364265, verdict FAILED → fixed): (major) `swap_pane` still
  gated on the shadow map — rewritten store-first with legacy's
  200-`{message:'panes not found'}` decline shape (no 404 exists on the
  legacy swap route); stale-shadow/mirror-only regression tests; (minor)
  browser title hostname now lowercases (`new URL` canonicalization).
- **Round 4** (pid 3281298, verdict FAILED → fixed): (major) the store-first
  swap left the fresh-agent session binding (`panes` map) behind — bindings
  now follow swapped content (legacy's content-driven fresh-agent send
  resolution parity), with a fresh-agent↔browser swap regression test;
  (minor, recorded, not fixed) `url_hostname` is deliberately a cheap
  extractor, not full WHATWG URL parity (IDNA/punycode, invalid-port rejects).
- **Round 5** (pid 679777): **PASSED** — "Only a minor edge-case issue
  remains... stop iterating because only minor/nit issues remain." The nit is
  the recorded `url_hostname` approximation (IDNA/punycode + invalid-port
  corners vs `new URL`).
