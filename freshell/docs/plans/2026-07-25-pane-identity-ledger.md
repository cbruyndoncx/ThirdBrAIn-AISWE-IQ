**Goal:** Build the server-side pane-identity ledger — a durable per-row disk store under `~/.freshell/pane-ledger/` written durably AT identity events, awaited before the event is answered — wire it into all terminal-pane identity write triggers (claude pre-allocation, codex candidate adoption, opencode/amplifier locator resolution, pending markers at spawn, best-effort retire), and ship the three reads in the same slice (inventory sessionRef stamping, ledger-backed `ever_observed`, the claude restore-resolution ladder), plus P1.10: pin opencode locator arming for restore-created panes that lack identity.

**Architecture:** A new `pane_ledger` module in `crates/freshell-ws` holding two row types with different keys and different rights: **binding rows** keyed on server-minted `sessionRef` (provider, sessionId) with `terminalId` as a secondary index, and **pending markers** keyed on `terminalId` that are NEVER promoted or joined — resolution writes a fresh binding row FIRST, then deletes the marker (pinned order). Each row is its own JSON file written via the existing `atomic_write_durable` (temp+rename+fsync); `PaneLedger` additionally maintains an **in-memory write-through index**, loaded once at construction with a single directory scan, so ALL steady-state reads answer from memory — never a per-call directory scan (V1.md measured full-store scans at 21ms@1k / 108ms@5k / 426ms@20k rows, and the TTL math yields 1.2k–12k rows; the single-writer process makes invalidation trivial). Because each durable write costs ~15ms p50 / 21–64ms p99 in fsyncs on this host (V1.md), every ledger **write on an async path** (the `handle_create` tail, kill hygiene, the codex/opencode/amplifier resolution hooks) runs via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking(...)` and is **AWAITED before the reply / subsequent processing** — durable-before-answer is fully preserved; only the thread that blocks changes (the codebase's own PTY-spawn precedent, `terminal.rs:1369-1379`). `PaneLedger`'s API stays synchronous (`Arc<PaneLedger>` is Send+Sync); call sites wrap. Truly-synchronous contexts (the PTY `on_exit` hook, which runs on a blocking thread; the pre-serve boot scan in `main`) may call it inline. A boot scan quarantines corrupt rows per-row (never per-store), sweeps stale markers (crash-window residue AND markers aged past `PENDING_MARKER_TTL_MS` — bounds leaked-marker lifetime), repairs the supersession crash window, and GCs bound rows to tombstones (never deletion; tombstone DELETION requires transcript absence established by a **direct filesystem check by provider path convention** — never by `probe.exists()==Absent` alone, whose Absent can be transiently stale, permanently wrong for index-filtered transcripts, or mass-wrong on a provider I/O hiccup, V10.md; probe Absent remains fine for non-destructive decisions). The ledger is constructed once in `freshell-server::main` under an exclusive advisory flock (single-writer guard, the `ConfigLock` pattern — V2.md), hangs off `WsState` as an `Arc`, and is consulted by three reads that ship in this slice. REST/freshagent-created terminal panes are OUT of this slice's write triggers (deferred to P1.13 — see Global Constraints).

**Tech Stack:** Rust (serde/serde_json, tokio, tracing), existing `freshell-ws` test harness (`tests/common/mod.rs`, real axum server on ephemeral loopback ports), Playwright e2e (`RustServer` fixture, fake CLIs).

## Global Constraints

- **Worktree:** all work happens in `/home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/pane-identity-ledger`, branch `feat/pane-identity-ledger`, based on `origin/main @ c491aee0`.
- **Drift/rebase:** proceed on the current base (`c491aee0`). The known drift `c491aee0..c3b468b0` (#534 client-only, #535 deploy-tab-diff script/spec) touches ZERO plan anchor files (V4.md — exhaustive file-set diff). Rebase onto `origin/main` before the final push (Task 14) — expected conflict-free (disjoint files) — and re-verify the plan's `file:line` anchors after any rebase.
- **The spec** is §4.2 of `/home/dan/code/freshell/docs/plans/2026-07-24-restart-resilience-architecture-analysis.md` (UNTRACKED — read via that absolute path; **never commit that file**). Every pinned rule there is a requirement.
- **TDD:** Red-Green-Refactor for every task; never skip the failing-test run, never skip the refactor pass.
- **Store location:** `~/.freshell/pane-ledger/` (user-approved), resolved via `resolve_home()` precedence (`FRESHELL_HOME` → `HOME`) ONCE in `main.rs` and dependency-injected as a path — the module itself never reads env vars.
- **Scope: TERMINAL panes only.** Fresh-agent ledger wiring is a later slice (P1.13). The resume-invocation record for a terminal pane is `{provider, sessionId, mode, cwd}` — everything `resolve_coding_cli_command` needs to re-issue the resume. The extended settings fields (model/sandbox/permissionMode/effort) ARE consumed by `resolve_coding_cli_command` for terminal panes too (`cli_launch.rs:106-124`, V11.md) — but they are sourced from the durable per-provider `ProviderSettings` store, not per-pane state, which is exactly why omitting them from v1 rows loses nothing; a restart-resume re-resolves from the same durable settings store the original launch used. Duplicating them per-row would be a write with no read in this slice (Principle 6). P1.13 may add them (and `paneKind`, deferred with them) as `Option` fields under `LEDGER_VERSION 1` losslessly — serde ignores unknown fields and missing `Option`s deserialize as `None`; quarantine keys on version mismatch only — and P1.13 must NOT add `deny_unknown_fields` or non-defaulted required fields under version 1 (V11.md).
- **Scope: REST/freshagent-created terminal panes are OUT of this slice's ledger write triggers**, deferred to P1.13. The freshagent REST API (`POST /api/tabs` → `freshell-freshagent/src/lib.rs:1176`; `POST /api/panes/{id}/split` → `pane_ops.rs:57`) spawns terminal panes via `registry.create` + `set_meta` (`terminal_tabs.rs:866,:926`), supports claude resume, performs no `identity.upsert`, and CANNOT reach freshell-ws hooks (documented circular-dep gap, `terminal_tabs.rs:833-840`; V6.md, V7.md). Crate-placement consequence, accepted: `pane_ledger` lives in `freshell-ws`, unreachable from `freshell-freshagent` — P1.13 will need to move/hoist it to a crate both can reach; the module is self-contained, so the move is mechanical. Task 12's restore live-guard compensates for the REST hole on the read side (see Task 12).
- **Scope fence — do NOT touch:** freshagent crates' `claude.rs`/`snapshot.rs` (Lane A2), `tabs_persist*`/`tabs_snapshots*`/persistMiddleware (A1/A6 — *calling* the already-`pub` `atomic_write_durable` is fine; do not edit it), `TerminalView`/`FreshAgentView` (A4), `registry.rs` scrollback (A5), `reconcile.rs` verdict-derivation logic (only the `ever_observed` INPUT changes, indirectly, via the probe impl in `freshell-server`). Lane A2 also touches `terminal.rs` (FreshAgentAttach arm) — keep all `terminal.rs` edits confined to the create/identity path (`handle_create` tail, exit/kill hooks, the restore ladder helpers). No kimi/gemini work.
- **Full-verdict wiring is Phase 3:** quarantine-in-verdict (`ledger_quarantined` breadcrumb) and superseded-claim `corrected:true` verdicts are exposed **at the ledger API level** here (chain-terminus lookup, quarantine query, loud ERROR logs); reconcile-verdict plumbing lands with the Phase 3 lane that owns verdict derivation. The frozen client does not yet render `durability.degraded`; the load-bearing pinned property shipped here is that the warning frame is pushed LIVE at failure time (wire-asserted by test), never posthumously.
- **Tests:** `cargo test` and Playwright are NOT coordinator-gated. `npm test`/`npm run check` ARE — set `FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY`, check `npm run test:status` first, WAIT if a sibling holds the gate (5 sibling lanes run concurrently).
- **Ports:** never bind or touch 3001/3002. Rust integration tests bind `127.0.0.1:0`; e2e uses `RustServer`'s `findFreePort()`.
- **Process safety:** NEVER restart the user's self-hosted server; never broad kill patterns; record PIDs. Disk is TIGHT: the root fs is ~96% full with only ~5.6 GB free to non-root (V2.md statfs) — the Task 1 Step 0 baseline build (`cargo test` target artifacts) is the main disk consumer. On ENOSPC, HALT and report rather than deleting anything outside this worktree.
- **CI gates:** `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` are enforced by CI; every task's code must be fmt- and clippy-clean. Rust tests are NOT in CI — local `cargo test` is the only test gate.
- **Structural limits:** ≤1K lines per file (hence `pane_ledger_tests.rs` as a `#[path]` submodule, mirroring `tabs_persist_tests.rs`).
- **PR policy: NOT approved.** Commit locally per task, push the branch at the end, **STOP before `gh pr create`**.
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits with scope (observed convention), one focused commit per task.

### Task 1: Ledger core — schema, atomic binding-row writes, basic reads

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs`
- Create: `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger_tests.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/lib.rs` (mod registration only — the `pub mod` block at `lib.rs:23-39`, alphabetical order)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/Cargo.toml` (unix-only `libc` dependency for the flock guard)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `freshell_protocol::SessionLocator` (`crates/freshell-protocol/src/common.rs:174-177`, `{provider: String, session_id: String}`, serde camelCase); `crate::tabs_persist::atomic_write_durable(destination: &Path, temporary: &Path, bytes: &[u8]) -> std::io::Result<()>` (already `pub`, `tabs_persist.rs:706-732`).
- Produces (later tasks rely on these exact signatures):
  - `pub const LEDGER_VERSION: u32 = 1;`
  - `pub struct BindingRow { pub ledger_version: u32, pub provider: String, pub session_id: String, pub mode: String, pub cwd: Option<String>, pub live_terminal_id: Option<String>, pub create_request_id: Option<String>, pub created_at: i64, pub updated_at: i64, pub last_observed_at: i64, pub state: RowState, pub retired_reason: Option<RetiredReason>, pub superseded_by: Option<SessionLocator> }`
  - `pub enum RowState { Bound, Retired }`, `pub enum RetiredReason { Superseded, Closed, GcExpired }`
  - `pub struct BindingWrite<'a> { pub provider: &'a str, pub session_id: &'a str, pub terminal_id: &'a str, pub mode: &'a str, pub cwd: Option<&'a str>, pub create_request_id: Option<&'a str>, pub now_ms: i64 }`
  - `pub struct PaneLedger` with `pub fn new(root: Option<PathBuf>) -> Self` (lock-free; tests + harness), `pub fn new_locked(root: Option<PathBuf>) -> Self` (production: exclusive flock single-writer guard, degrades to disabled), `pub fn disabled() -> Self`, `pub fn record_binding(&self, w: &BindingWrite<'_>) -> std::io::Result<()>`, `pub fn load_binding(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> Option<BindingRow>`, `pub fn ever_bound(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> bool`, `pub fn list_bindings(&self) -> Vec<BindingRow>`, `pub fn bound_session_ref_for_terminal(&self, terminal_id: &str) -> Option<SessionLocator>`, `pub fn lookup_by_create_request_id(&self, provider: &str, create_request_id: &str) -> Option<BindingRow>`
  - **Read policy (V1.md / A15):** `PaneLedger` holds an in-memory write-through index (`LedgerIndex`, private) loaded ONCE in `new()` by a single directory scan. ALL steady-state reads — `load_binding`, `ever_bound`, `list_bindings`, `bound_session_ref_for_terminal`, `lookup_by_create_request_id`, later `pending_for_terminal` and supersession detection — answer from memory; no API does a per-call directory scan. Every file mutation updates the index in the same locked section (write-through). Reads are therefore cheap enough to call inline on async paths; only WRITES fsync and need `spawn_blocking` at async call sites (Tasks 6/8).

- [ ] **Step 0: Baseline green.** FIRST run `npm ci` in the worktree root — this is dependency install only, NOT the coordinator-gated `npm test`/`npm run check` (no gate needed). The worktree ships without `node_modules/`, and `mcp_inject.rs:123-126`'s tsx check then deterministically fails ALL provider PTY spawns — 14 failures on the untouched base with this single environmental root cause (V3.md). THEN run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws` (from the worktree root; generous timeout — real PTY spawns). Expected: PASS. If any failure survives `npm ci`, STOP and report — do not build on a red base.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** Create `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger_tests.rs`:

```rust
//! Unit tests for `crate::pane_ledger` (P1.8, spec §4.2). Kept in a sibling
//! file (the `tabs_persist_tests.rs` convention) to respect the ≤1K-lines
//! file limit as the ledger's test surface grows.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure.** Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws pane_ledger`
Expected: FAIL to compile — `pane_ledger` module does not exist (`unresolved import` / `file not found for module`). A compile failure of the new tests IS the red state.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation.** Create `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs`:

```rust
//! P1.8 — the server-side pane-identity ledger (restart-resilience campaign
//! §4.2): a small per-row disk store under `<home>/.freshell/pane-ledger/`,
//! written durably at identity events with atomic temp+rename
//! (`crate::tabs_persist::atomic_write_durable`).
//!
//! Two row types with different keys and different rights:
//!
//! * **Binding rows** — durable identity facts, keyed on the server-minted
//!   `sessionRef` (provider, sessionId), with `terminalId` as a secondary
//!   index. A binding row is *the resume-invocation record*: it stores
//!   exactly what re-issuing the provider's resume needs (for terminal panes:
//!   provider, sessionId, mode, cwd). Layout:
//!   `bindings/<enc(provider)>/<enc(sessionId)>.json`.
//! * **Pending markers** — evidence that identity establishment was in
//!   flight, keyed on `terminalId` (the only stable server-minted id that
//!   exists pre-identity). NEVER promoted, never joined (G1): resolution
//!   writes a fresh binding row FIRST, then deletes the marker. Layout:
//!   `pending/<enc(terminalId)>.json`.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT stored: scrollback (own store, P2.19), transcripts
//! (provider-owned), layout (client-owned). NOT keyed on `createRequestId`
//! (D4/V9.md: every restore path that re-creates an anchored pane re-mints
//! it first; only the orphaned in-flight-create replay preserves it) —
//! stored only as an advisory field, never an identity join key.
//!
//! Corruption policy: fail loud PER-ROW, never per-store — an unparsable row
//! is quarantined (renamed aside + logged), never silently dropped, and never
//! causes healthy rows to be skipped.
//!
//! Write-failure policy: a ledger write failure never blocks the
//! create/identity event, but it is never silent — see
//! [`surface_write_failure`].
//!
//! Read/scan policy (V1.md / A15): a write-through in-memory index, loaded
//! ONCE at construction by a single directory scan, answers ALL steady-state
//! reads — no API does a per-call directory scan (full-store scans measured
//! at 21ms@1k / 426ms@20k rows; TTL math yields 1.2k-12k rows). Files stay
//! the durable source of truth; this process is the only writer
//! (single-writer flock, [`PaneLedger::new_locked`]), so write-through
//! invalidation is trivial. Reads never touch the fs and may run inline on
//! async paths; WRITES fsync (~15ms p50 on this host) and must be wrapped in
//! `spawn_blocking` at async call sites (the `terminal.rs:1369-1379`
//! PTY-spawn precedent) — the sync API here stays call-site-agnostic.

        .parent()
        .ok_or_else(|| std::io::Error::new(std::io::ErrorKind::InvalidInput, "row has no parent"))?;
    std::fs::create_dir_all(parent)?;
    let millis = std::time::SystemTime::now()
        .duration_since(std::time::UNIX_EPOCH)
        .map(|d| d.as_millis())
        .unwrap_or(0);
    let tmp = parent.join(format!("{file_name}.tmp-{}-{millis}", std::process::id()));
    crate::tabs_persist::atomic_write_durable(dest, &tmp, &bytes)
}

#[cfg(test)]
#[path = "pane_ledger_tests.rs"]
mod tests;
```

Then register the module in `crates/freshell-ws/src/lib.rs` — in the alphabetical `pub mod` block (between `pub mod origin;` and `pub mod reconcile;`):

```rust
pub mod pane_ledger;
```

And add two dependencies to `crates/freshell-ws/Cargo.toml`.

First, `serde` with derive — the module's five `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` types and `serde::de::DeserializeOwned` bound need the `serde` crate itself, which freshell-ws does NOT yet declare (it currently has only `serde_json`). The workspace root already defines `serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }` in `[workspace.dependencies]` (root `Cargo.toml:32`), so add to freshell-ws's `[dependencies]` table (alphabetical, next to the existing `serde_json`):

```toml
serde = { workspace = true }
```

Second, the flock dependency — the same unix-only `libc` dependency `freshell-server` declares for `ConfigLock` (see its Cargo.toml comment "`flock(2)` for `settings_store.rs`'s advisory cross-process config lock"):

```toml
[target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]
# `flock(2)` for pane_ledger's single-writer store lock (ConfigLock pattern).
libc = "0.2"
```

(If freshell-ws already has a unix-only dependency table, merge into it.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify pass.** Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws pane_ledger`
Expected: PASS (8 tests; the flock test is unix-only).

- [ ] **Step 5: Refactor + gates.** Re-read the new module for duplication and naming; run `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy -p freshell-ws --all-targets -- -D warnings`. Fix everything.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger_tests.rs crates/freshell-ws/src/lib.rs crates/freshell-ws/Cargo.toml Cargo.lock
git commit -m "feat(ws): pane-identity ledger core - binding rows, atomic per-row writes, indexed reads, single-writer lock (P1.8)"

### Task 2: Supersession — retire-never-defend, chain-terminus reader

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger_tests.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1's `PaneLedger`, `BindingRow`, `RowState`, `RetiredReason`.
- Produces:
  - `pub struct Resolution { pub row: BindingRow, pub corrected: bool }`
  - `pub fn lookup_by_session(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> Option<Resolution>` — follows the `supersededBy` chain to its terminus; `corrected == true` iff at least one hop was taken.
  - `record_binding` now performs supersession: when the same `terminalId` already owns a DIFFERENT bound identity, the new `bound` row is written FIRST, then the old row is retired (`superseded`, `supersededBy` set) — pinned order (spec §4.2 G3).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** Append to `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger_tests.rs`:

```rust
#[test]
fn rebind_retires_old_row() {
    // Red test `rebind-retires-old-row` (spec §4.2 G3): a pane's binding
    // legitimately moves -> the writer retires the old row and writes the
    // new one; the old row records WHERE identity went.
    let root = temp_root("rebind");
    let ledger = PaneLedger::new(Some(root.clone()));
    ledger.record_binding(&write("codex", "th-old", "t1", 1_000)).unwrap();
    ledger.record_binding(&write("codex", "th-new", "t1", 2_000)).unwrap();

    let old = ledger.load_binding("codex", "th-old").unwrap();
    assert_eq!(old.state, RowState::Retired);
    assert_eq!(old.retired_reason, Some(RetiredReason::Superseded));
    let by = old.superseded_by.expect("supersededBy set");
    assert_eq!(by.provider, "codex");
    assert_eq!(by.session_id, "th-new");

    let new = ledger.load_binding("codex", "th-new").unwrap();
    assert_eq!(new.state, RowState::Bound);
    assert_eq!(new.live_terminal_id.as_deref(), Some("t1"));
    std::fs::remove_dir_all(&root).ok();
}

#[test]
fn client_claims_superseded_ref_is_answered_from_the_chain_terminus() {
    // Red test `client-claims-superseded-ref` (ledger-API level; full
    // verdict wiring is Phase 3): a lookup for a superseded ref follows
    // `supersededBy` to the live bound row and reports corrected:true —
    // never returns the retired row as the answer.
    let root = temp_root("chain");
    let ledger = PaneLedger::new(Some(root.clone()));
    ledger.record_binding(&write("codex", "th-1", "t1", 1_000)).unwrap();
    ledger.record_binding(&write("codex", "th-2", "t1", 2_000)).unwrap();
    ledger.record_binding(&write("codex", "th-3", "t1", 3_000)).unwrap();

    let hit = ledger.lookup_by_session("codex", "th-1").expect("resolves");
    assert!(hit.corrected);
    assert_eq!(hit.row.session_id, "th-3");
    assert_eq!(hit.row.state, RowState::Bound);

    // A direct claim of the live terminus is NOT a correction.
    let direct = ledger.lookup_by_session("codex", "th-3").unwrap();
    assert!(!direct.corrected);

    // A retired row with no successor (e.g. closed) is returned as-is so
    // callers can apply their own reader rule — but never invents a bound.
    std::fs::remove_dir_all(&root).ok();
}

#[test]
fn rebind_to_the_same_identity_is_not_a_supersession() {
    let root = temp_root("samebind");
    let ledger = PaneLedger::new(Some(root.clone()));
    ledger.record_binding(&write("codex", "th-1", "t1", 1_000)).unwrap();
    ledger.record_binding(&write("codex", "th-1", "t1", 2_000)).unwrap();
    let row = ledger.load_binding("codex", "th-1").unwrap();
    assert_eq!(row.state, RowState::Bound);
    assert_eq!(row.retired_reason, None);
    std::fs::remove_dir_all(&root).ok();
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure.** Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws pane_ledger`
Expected: FAIL — `lookup_by_session` does not exist (compile error), and after adding stubs, `rebind_retires_old_row` fails (old row still `Bound`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** In `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs`:

Add the `Resolution` type after `QuarantinedRow`:

```rust
/// A chain-terminus lookup result. `corrected == true` means the caller's
/// claimed ref was superseded and this row is the live successor.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Resolution {
    pub row: BindingRow,
    pub corrected: bool,
}
```

Extend `record_binding_locked` — replace its body's opening with supersession detection (final body):

```rust
    fn record_binding_locked(
        &self,
        root: &Path,
        index: &mut LedgerIndex,
        w: &BindingWrite<'_>,
    ) -> std::io::Result<()> {
        // Supersession (G3, retire-never-defend): if this terminal already
        // owns a DIFFERENT bound identity, the order is pinned — write the
        // new `bound` row FIRST, then retire the old. A crash between the
        // two leaves two bound rows; the boot-scan repair (Task 4) closes
        // that window. Detection is a memory scan over the index (V1.md).
        let previous = index
            .bindings
            .values()
            .find(|r| {
                r.state == RowState::Bound

        let existing = index.bindings.get(&key);
        let created_at = existing.map(|r| r.created_at).unwrap_or(w.now_ms);
        if existing.is_some_and(|r| r.retired_reason == Some(RetiredReason::GcExpired)) {
            tracing::info!(
                target: "freshell_ws::pane_ledger",
                provider = %w.provider,
                session_id = %w.session_id,
                "pane_ledger_revived: gc_expired tombstone re-bound by a live identity event"
            );
        }
        let row = BindingRow {
            ledger_version: LEDGER_VERSION,
            provider: w.provider.to_string(),
            session_id: w.session_id.to_string(),
            mode: w.mode.to_string(),
            cwd: w.cwd.map(str::to_string),
            live_terminal_id: Some(w.terminal_id.to_string()),
            create_request_id: w.create_request_id.map(str::to_string),
            created_at,

        };
        self.write_binding(root, index, &row)?; // new bound row FIRST (pinned)

        if let Some(mut old) = previous {
            old.state = RowState::Retired;
            old.retired_reason = Some(RetiredReason::Superseded);
            old.superseded_by = Some(SessionLocator {
                provider: w.provider.to_string(),
                session_id: w.session_id.to_string(),
            });
            old.updated_at = w.now_ms;

        }
        Ok(())
    }
```

Add the chain-terminus reader to `impl PaneLedger`:

```rust
    /// Follow the `supersededBy` chain from a claimed ref to its terminus.

    /// and retires its predecessor in the same act) — the hop cap is a

    pub fn lookup_by_session(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> Option<Resolution> {
        self.root.as_ref()?;
        let index = self.guard(); // memory-only chain walk (V1.md read policy)
        let mut row = index
            .bindings
            .get(&(provider.to_string(), session_id.to_string()))
            .cloned()?;
        let mut corrected = false;
        let mut hops = 0u32;
        while row.state == RowState::Retired {
            let Some(next) = row.superseded_by.clone() else {
                break; // closed / gc_expired terminus — caller applies its reader rule
            };
            hops += 1;
            if hops > 32 {

### Task 3: Pending markers — pinned resolution order, collision idempotence

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger_tests.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Tasks 1–2.
- Produces:
  - `pub fn record_pending(&self, terminal_id: &str, mode: &str, cwd: Option<&str>, now_ms: i64) -> std::io::Result<()>`
  - `pub fn resolve_pending(&self, w: &BindingWrite<'_>) -> std::io::Result<()>` — binding row FIRST, then marker delete; idempotent under collision.
  - `pub fn delete_pending(&self, terminal_id: &str) -> std::io::Result<()>` — missing file is Ok (used by the observed-exit hygiene, Task 6).
  - `pub fn pending_for_terminal(&self, terminal_id: &str) -> Option<PendingMarker>` — applies the reader rule: a marker whose terminalId already has a binding row is STALE and answered `None`.

### Task 4: Boot scan — quarantine, stale-marker sweep, supersession repair, GC-to-tombstone

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger_tests.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Tasks 1–3.
- Produces:
  - `pub const PENDING_MARKER_TTL_MS: i64` — bounds leaked-marker lifetime (A8/V7: resolver-less crash residue must not accumulate forever).
  - `pub struct BootScanReport { pub quarantined: Vec<QuarantinedRow>, pub stale_markers_removed: Vec<String>, pub supersession_repairs: Vec<(SessionLocator, SessionLocator)>, pub gc_tombstoned: Vec<SessionLocator>, pub tombstones_deleted: Vec<SessionLocator> }`
  - `pub fn boot_scan(&self, now_ms: i64, transcript_absent: &dyn Fn(&str, &str) -> bool) -> BootScanReport` — **closure contract (V10.md):** `transcript_absent(provider, session_id)` must return `true` ONLY when the transcript is definitively absent, established by a DIRECT filesystem check by provider path convention (Task 5 supplies that closure). `probe.exists()==Absent` alone is NOT an acceptable implementation — the index's Absent can be transiently stale (stale-while-revalidate), permanently wrong (cwd-less/unreadable/amplifier-metadata exclusions), or mass-wrong for a whole provider (discover() swallows I/O errors and the refresh prunes everything). Anything uncertain/cold answers `false`, which safely defers tombstone deletion.
  - `pub fn gc(&self, now_ms: i64, transcript_absent: &dyn Fn(&str, &str) -> bool) -> BootScanReport` — the periodic subset (GC-to-tombstone + conditional tombstone deletion + aged-marker sweep). Same closure contract.
  - `pub fn quarantined_rows(&self) -> Vec<QuarantinedRow>` — Phase-3 verdict surfacing consumes this; here it is the API + loud-ERROR surface.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** Append to `pane_ledger_tests.rs`:

Note `boot_scan`/`gc` take `&self` and mutate files AND the write-through index under the ONE `Mutex<LedgerIndex>` guard — writers and readers are serialized against them by construction. `quarantine_unparsable`'s directory walk is boot-only (steady-state reads never scan, V1.md); quarantined/wrong-version files were never admitted to the index by `load_index`, so quarantine needs no index maintenance.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify pass.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws pane_ledger` — Expected: PASS (all tasks-1-4 tests).

- [ ] **Step 5: Refactor + gates.** Check `pane_ledger.rs` length — if it now exceeds ~1K lines, move `BootScanReport`/scan internals verbatim into a `pane_ledger_scan.rs` submodule (`#[path]`-free, plain `mod pane_ledger_scan;` is NOT needed — prefer keeping one module; only split if over the limit). `cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy -p freshell-ws --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger_tests.rs
git commit -m "feat(ws): ledger boot scan - per-row quarantine, stale-marker sweep, supersession repair, GC-to-tombstone"
```

### Task 5: Wiring — WsState field, main.rs construction, boot scan + periodic GC, harness support

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/lib.rs` (the `WsState` struct)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/common/mod.rs`
- Modify: every `WsState { … }` literal the compiler flags (known: `crates/freshell-ws/src/opencode_association.rs` tests' `state_with_locator`, `crates/freshell-ws/src/amplifier_association.rs` tests, possibly `lib.rs`/`terminal.rs`/`activity.rs` inline tests and other `tests/*.rs` harnesses)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1's `PaneLedger::{new, disabled}`, Task 4's `boot_scan`/`gc`.
- Produces:
  - `WsState.pane_ledger: std::sync::Arc<crate::pane_ledger::PaneLedger>` — every later task's call sites use `state.pane_ledger`.
  - `common::spawn_server_with_ledger(cli_commands: Vec<CliCommandSpec>, ledger_dir: &std::path::Path) -> (String, freshell_terminal::TerminalRegistry, std::sync::Arc<freshell_ws::pane_ledger::PaneLedger>)` in `tests/common/mod.rs` — the third element is the SERVER'S own ledger Arc (required by tests that seed or poll the live server's index-backed reads; Tasks 6, 10, 12).

- [ ] **Step 1: RED — add the field and let the compiler drive.** In `crates/freshell-ws/src/lib.rs`, find the `WsState` struct (fields like `pub identity: crate::identity::TerminalIdentityRegistry` at ~`lib.rs:128`) and add, with a doc comment, keeping neighbors' style:

```rust
    /// P1.8: the durable pane-identity ledger (spec §4.2). Constructed once
    /// in `freshell-server::main` (root `<home>/.freshell/pane-ledger`,
    /// `PaneLedger::disabled()` when no home resolves) and shared with the
    /// existence probe. Arc'd: identity events write it durably before they
    /// are answered (async paths wrap the sync API in awaited spawn_blocking).
    pub pane_ledger: std::sync::Arc<crate::pane_ledger::PaneLedger>,
```

Run: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`
Expected: FAIL — every `WsState { … }` literal is missing the field. This IS the red step; the error list is the complete work list.

- [ ] **Step 2: GREEN — update every literal.** For each error site:
  - **Production (`crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs`):** construct the real ledger BEFORE the `WsState` literal, next to where `resolve_home()` output is available (the tabs-snapshots wiring at `main.rs:704-711` is the precedent):

```rust
    // P1.8: the pane-identity ledger (spec §4.2). Root resolved ONCE here;
    // the module itself never reads env vars. No home => disabled no-op,
    // same policy as tabs-snapshots. `new_locked` = the single-writer
    // guard (V2.md): exclusive flock on <root>/lock, ConfigLock pattern —
    // a second server on the same home comes up with a DISABLED ledger and
    // a loud ERROR instead of two writers corrupting one store.
    let pane_ledger = std::sync::Arc::new(freshell_ws::pane_ledger::PaneLedger::new_locked(
        home.as_ref().map(|h| h.join(".freshell").join("pane-ledger")),
    ));
```

    and in the `WsState` literal add `pane_ledger: std::sync::Arc::clone(&pane_ledger),`.
  - **Every test/harness literal:** add `pane_ledger: std::sync::Arc::new(freshell_ws::pane_ledger::PaneLedger::disabled()),` (inside `freshell-ws` itself use `crate::pane_ledger::PaneLedger::disabled()`).

Run: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` until clean.

- [ ] **Step 3: Boot scan + periodic GC in `main.rs`.** First add the DIRECT-STAT transcript check (V10.md: `probe.exists()==Absent` is NOT definitive — it can be transiently stale under stale-while-revalidate, permanently wrong for transcripts the index filters out (cwd-less/unreadable/amplifier-metadata exclusions), and mass-wrong for a whole provider when `discover()` swallows an I/O error and the refresh prunes everything). Tombstone DELETION must never key on it. Add to `main.rs` (or a small helper module beside `existence.rs`):

```rust
/// P1.8 tombstone-deletion gate (V10.md): `true` ONLY when a DIRECT
/// filesystem check by provider path convention finds no transcript.
/// Mirror each provider's on-disk convention from its freshell-sessions
/// source (claude discover: directory_index.rs:206; codex walk: :375 with
/// filename-UUID extraction :414-421; amplifier: amplifier.rs session dirs).
/// Providers without a cheap direct check (opencode: sqlite-backed) answer
/// `false` — deletion deferred, never risked. Unknown providers: `false`.
fn transcript_definitively_absent(home: &std::path::Path, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> bool {
    match provider {
        "claude" => {
            // ~/.claude/projects/<proj>/<session_id>.jsonl — any match means present.
            let projects = home.join(".claude").join("projects");
            let Ok(dirs) = std::fs::read_dir(&projects) else { return false }; // unreadable => defer
            !dirs.flatten().any(|d| d.path().join(format!("{session_id}.jsonl")).is_file())
        }
        "codex" => {
            // ~/.codex/sessions/** rollout files carry the session UUID in the
            // filename — walk and match (bounded: sessions tree only).
            let root = home.join(".codex").join("sessions");
            if !root.is_dir() { return false; } // unreadable/missing home => defer
            !walk_contains_filename_fragment(&root, session_id)
        }
        "amplifier" => {
            // Amplifier session dir named by session id (mirror amplifier.rs's
            // home resolution — the same provider_home() root main.rs already
            // computes for the AmplifierSource).
            let Some(dir) = amplifier_session_dir(home, session_id) else { return false };
            !dir.exists()
        }
        _ => false, // opencode (sqlite) + unknown providers: defer deletion
    }
}
```

(`walk_contains_filename_fragment` = a small recursive walk returning whether any filename contains the fragment; `amplifier_session_dir` mirrors the path the `AmplifierSource` construction in `main.rs:373-386` uses. On ANY read error return "present" (`false` from the outer fn) — deletion is the destructive branch, so uncertainty always defers. Unit-test the claude arm at minimum: present ⇒ false, empty tree ⇒ true, unreadable root ⇒ false.)

The existence probe is constructed around `main.rs:425-435`. AFTER `pane_ledger` is constructed, add:

```rust
    // P1.8 boot hygiene: quarantine, stale-marker sweep, supersession
    // repair, GC. Tombstone deletion keys on the DIRECT stat above — never
    // on probe.exists()==Absent (V10.md). Runs BEFORE the server accepts
    // connections, so calling the blocking ledger API inline here is fine.
    {
        let now = std::time::SystemTime::now()
            .duration_since(std::time::UNIX_EPOCH)
            .map(|d| d.as_millis() as i64)
            .unwrap_or(0);
        // `home` = the same Option<PathBuf> resolve_home() output the ledger
        // root was derived from. No home => the ledger is disabled and the
        // closure is never consulted; answering false (defer) is still safe.
        let scan_home = home.clone();
        let report = pane_ledger.boot_scan(now, &move |provider, session_id| {
            scan_home
                .as_deref()
                .is_some_and(|h| transcript_definitively_absent(h, provider, session_id))
        });
        if !report.quarantined.is_empty() {
            tracing::error!(
                count = report.quarantined.len(),
                "pane_ledger_boot: rows quarantined (see per-row errors above)"
            );
        }
    }

    // P1.8 periodic GC (boot-time + periodic, spec §4.2 lifecycle).
    {
        let ledger = std::sync::Arc::clone(&pane_ledger);
        let gc_home = home.clone(); // same Option<PathBuf> as above
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut ticker = tokio::time::interval(std::time::Duration::from_secs(6 * 60 * 60));
            ticker.tick().await; // the immediate first tick — boot_scan already ran
            loop {
                ticker.tick().await;
                let ledger = std::sync::Arc::clone(&ledger);
                let home = gc_home.clone();
                let _ = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || {
                    let now = std::time::SystemTime::now()
                        .duration_since(std::time::UNIX_EPOCH)
                        .map(|d| d.as_millis() as i64)
                        .unwrap_or(0);
                    // Same Option handling as the boot-scan closure above:
                    // no home => defer (false) — never the destructive branch.
                    ledger.gc(now, &|provider, session_id| {
                        home.as_deref()
                            .is_some_and(|h| transcript_definitively_absent(h, provider, session_id))
                    });
                })
                .await;
            }
        });
    }
```

    Adapt variable names to what `main.rs` actually calls its resolved home; keep the semantics exactly as written. If the probe is constructed AFTER the `WsState` literal today, construct the ledger first and move the boot-scan block after probe construction — construction order: ledger → probe (Task 11 hands it the ledger) → boot scan. (The probe is still used by Task 11's `ever_observed` and by reconcile — probe `Absent` remains fine for those NON-destructive decisions.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Harness variant.** In `crates/freshell-ws/tests/common/mod.rs`, add next to `spawn_server_with_specs` (`:91`), mirroring its body exactly but parameterizing the ledger:

```rust
/// [`spawn_server_with_specs`], with a REAL pane ledger rooted at
/// `ledger_dir` (P1.8 tests). Two servers pointed at the same dir model a
/// restart. Returns the server's own `Arc<PaneLedger>` too: with the
/// write-through in-memory index (Task 1 / V1.md), only writes routed
/// through the SERVER'S instance are visible to its reads — tests that
/// seed or poll the live server's ledger must use this Arc, while
/// durability assertions may still construct fresh read-only instances
/// (whose construction-time scan sees whatever is on disk). Uses the
/// lock-free `PaneLedger::new` (the flock single-writer guard is a
/// production `main.rs` concern — `new_locked`).

### Task 6: terminal.rs write triggers — binding at create, pending marker at spawn, exit/kill hygiene

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-protocol/src/server_messages.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-protocol/tests/activity_extension.rs` (the exact-array pin on `EXTENSION_SERVER_MESSAGE_TYPES`, `:138-145` — V8.md)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/invariants.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs` (the `surface_write_failure` helper)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs`
- Create: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/pane_ledger_triggers.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `handle_create`'s tail (`terminal.rs:1504-1548`: `create_meta_record`, `state.identity.upsert`, `TerminalCreated`), the exit hook closure (`terminal.rs:1305-1340`), `handle_kill`/`kill_and_broadcast` (`terminal.rs:2085-2116`), `crate::terminal::now_ms`, Task 5's `state.pane_ledger`.
- Produces:
  - Protocol: `ServerMessage::DurabilityDegraded` (tag `"durability.degraded"`) with `pub struct DurabilityDegraded { pub terminal_id: String, pub reason: String, pub message: String }` (camelCase serde) — registered in `EXTENSION_SERVER_MESSAGE_TYPES` (the sanctioned escape hatch that keeps the frozen 53-type `SERVER_MESSAGE_TYPES` contract untouched, V8.md).
  - `crate::pane_ledger::surface_write_failure(state: &crate::WsState, terminal_id: &str, result: std::io::Result<()>)` — every ledger write at an identity event goes through this.
  - `crate::invariants::error_pane_ledger_write_failed(terminal_id: &str, err: &std::io::Error)`.
  - Behavior later tasks rely on: a create writes EITHER a binding row (identity known at spawn: claude pre-allocation, any restore/resume create) OR — **only for modes with a registered post-spawn resolver: `codex`, `opencode`, `amplifier`** — a pending marker (identity in flight). Claude NEVER gets a marker (no resolver exists; mainline fresh claude always has create-time identity via pre-allocation, and the degenerate payloads that skip pre-allocation — a mismatched-provider `sessionRef` or an empty-string session id, V5.md — spawn un-resumable and stay ledgerless BY DESIGN: a marker for them would be permanently unresolvable). Kimi/gemini/custom-extension modes likewise get NO marker (no resolver — V7.md; a marker would leak until the Task 4 TTL sweep). Observed PTY exit deletes the terminal's pending marker; explicit kill additionally retires the binding (`closed`).
  - **Write-path threading (V1.md / A1):** `handle_create` is async — its ledger writes (binding OR marker) run inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking(...)` and are AWAITED before `terminal.created` is sent (durable-before-answer preserved; fsync ~15ms p50 must not pin the per-connection dispatch task — the `terminal.rs:1369-1379` PTY-spawn precedent). The PTY `on_exit` hook runs on a blocking thread — its `delete_pending` calls the sync API inline (truly-synchronous context). The kill-path hygiene runs in async `handle_kill` via an awaited `spawn_blocking` after the kill, before the handler returns.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing integration tests.** Create `crates/freshell-ws/tests/pane_ledger_triggers.rs`:

```rust
//! P1.8 write-trigger integration tests: a REAL axum server + REAL WS client
//! (shared harness), asserting the on-disk ledger rows that identity events
//! must produce — including across a "restart" (a second PaneLedger instance
//! over the same dir; the crate-level shape of the SIGKILL wall tests).

Note for the implementer: mirror the exact create-JSON field spellings from `crates/freshell-ws/tests/codex_candidate_persisted.rs`'s `send_create` helper (`:67`) — if that helper spells fields differently (e.g. `shell` shape), copy its shape verbatim.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test pane_ledger_triggers` — Expected: FAIL — no binding row / marker is written (`expect("binding row written at create")` panics).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement — protocol message.** In `crates/freshell-protocol/src/server_messages.rs`, add next to the other structs (and the enum variant next to `TerminalMetaUpdated`'s at `:116-117`):

```rust
/// P1.8 write-failure policy (spec §4.2): pushed LIVE at ledger-write
/// failure time so the warning arrives BEFORE the restart it warns about —
/// never a posthumous verdict flag. Frozen clients ignore unknown frame
/// types; rendering lands with the Phase 3 client adoption lane.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct DurabilityDegraded {
    pub terminal_id: String,
    /// Machine-readable, e.g. "ledger_write_failed".
    pub reason: String,
    /// Human-readable pane warning.
    pub message: String,
}
```

and in the `ServerMessage` enum:

```rust
    #[serde(rename = "durability.degraded")]
    DurabilityDegraded(DurabilityDegraded),
```

Then register the frame type (V8.md — REQUIRED, or the protocol pinning tests fail): append `"durability.degraded"` to `EXTENSION_SERVER_MESSAGE_TYPES` (`server_messages.rs:205-209` — the sanctioned escape hatch that keeps the frozen 53-type `SERVER_MESSAGE_TYPES` inventory contract untouched), and update the exact-array assertion in `crates/freshell-protocol/tests/activity_extension.rs:138-145` to include the new entry (it currently pins `["amplifier.activity.list.response", "amplifier.activity.updated", "terminal.idle"]` byte-exact, plus disjointness from the frozen set). Note in a comment near the const entry: the existing `terminal.codex.durability.updated` frame (`server_messages.rs:179`) is a DIFFERENT family (codex sidecar durability); the new frame is intentionally general pane-durability — the name collision is nearest-neighbor only, not overlap.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement — invariant + surfacing helper.** In `crates/freshell-ws/src/invariants.rs` (next to `error_claude_restore_unresolved`, `:89-97`):

```rust
/// P1.8 (spec §4.2 write-failure policy): a ledger write failed. The event
/// itself proceeded (fail loud, degrade to status quo) — but this pane may
/// not survive a restart, and the live `durability.degraded` frame was
/// pushed at failure time.
pub(crate) fn error_pane_ledger_write_failed(terminal_id: &str, err: &std::io::Error) {
    tracing::error!(
        target: "freshell_ws::invariants",
        terminal_id = %terminal_id,
        error = %err,
        "pane_ledger_write_failed: identity event could not be durably recorded; \
         durability.degraded pushed live to attached clients"
    );
}
```

In `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs`:

```rust
/// The write-failure policy (spec §4.2): a ledger write failure NEVER blocks
/// the create/identity event, but it is never silent — structured ERROR +
/// invariant counter + a LIVE `durability.degraded` frame to attached
/// clients, at failure time (a verdict-time flag would be posthumous).
pub(crate) fn surface_write_failure(
    state: &crate::WsState,
    terminal_id: &str,
    result: std::io::Result<()>,
) {
    let Err(err) = result else { return };
    crate::invariants::error_pane_ledger_write_failed(terminal_id, &err);
    let msg = freshell_protocol::ServerMessage::DurabilityDegraded(
        freshell_protocol::DurabilityDegraded {
            terminal_id: terminal_id.to_string(),
            reason: "ledger_write_failed".to_string(),
            message: "This pane's identity could not be durably recorded; it may not survive a server restart.".to_string(),
        },
    );
    if let Ok(frame) = serde_json::to_string(&msg) {
        let _ = state.broadcast_tx.send(frame);
    }
}
```

(If `DurabilityDegraded` is not re-exported from `freshell_protocol`'s root, add it to the crate's existing re-export list.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement — create-path triggers.** In `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs`, in `handle_create`'s tail, immediately AFTER the `if let Some(record) = &create_meta_record { state.identity.upsert(...) }` block (`:1511-1525`) and BEFORE `let created = ServerMessage::TerminalCreated(...)` (`:1526`). First add, near the top of the file (module scope):

```rust
/// The modes that get a spawn-time pending marker: EXACTLY the modes with a
/// registered post-spawn identity resolver (codex candidate adoption,
/// opencode/amplifier locator sweeps). NOT "any non-shell mode" (V7.md):
/// claude has create-time identity (pre-allocation) and NO resolver — its
/// degenerate no-identity payloads (mismatched-provider sessionRef,
/// empty-string session id; V5.md) spawn un-resumable and stay ledgerless
/// by design; kimi/gemini/custom extension modes have no resolver, so a
/// marker for them could never resolve and would only leak until the TTL
/// sweep. Every mode listed here MUST have a resolution hook (Tasks 8-9).
const MARKER_MODES: [&str; 3] = ["codex", "opencode", "amplifier"];
```

then the trigger block:

```rust
    // P1.8 (spec §4.2 write triggers): the durable ledger write rides the
    // SAME identity event that seeds the in-memory registry — atomic
    // temp+rename, AWAITED before the create is answered (durable-before-
    // answer). It runs on the blocking pool, not the per-connection
    // dispatch task: each write costs ~15ms p50 / 21-64ms p99 in fsyncs
    // (V1.md), 2-3 orders past tokio's async-worker budget — the same
    // reasoning as the PTY spawn_blocking above (:1369-1379). A failure
    // never blocks the create but is surfaced LIVE (surface_write_failure).
    if let Some(record) = &create_meta_record {
        // Identity known at spawn: claude pre-allocation (trigger a) and
        // every resume/restore create (all providers) — a binding row.
        if let (Some(provider), Some(session_id)) =
            (record.provider.as_deref(), record.session_id.as_deref())
        {
            let ledger = std::sync::Arc::clone(&state.pane_ledger);
            let provider = provider.to_string();
            let session_id = session_id.to_string();
            let write_terminal_id = record.terminal_id.clone();
            let write_mode = mode.clone();
            let write_cwd = record.cwd.clone();
            let write_request_id = create.request_id.clone();
            let now = now_ms();
            let result = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || {
                ledger.record_binding(&crate::pane_ledger::BindingWrite {
                    provider: &provider,
                    session_id: &session_id,
                    terminal_id: &write_terminal_id,
                    mode: &write_mode,
                    cwd: write_cwd.as_deref(),
                    create_request_id: Some(&write_request_id),
                    now_ms: now,
                })
            })
            .await
            .unwrap_or_else(|join_err| Err(std::io::Error::other(join_err)));
            crate::pane_ledger::surface_write_failure(state, &record.terminal_id, result);
        }
    } else if MARKER_MODES.contains(&mode.as_str()) {
        // Identity-bearing pane whose identity is still in flight (fresh
        // codex/opencode/amplifier — trigger d): a durable pending marker
        // from spawn until resolution deletes it (binding-first order).
        let ledger = std::sync::Arc::clone(&state.pane_ledger);
        let write_terminal_id = terminal_id_for_meta.clone();
        let write_mode = mode.clone();
        let write_cwd = spec.cwd.clone();
        let now = now_ms();
        let result = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || {
            ledger.record_pending(&write_terminal_id, &write_mode, write_cwd.as_deref(), now)
        })
        .await
        .unwrap_or_else(|join_err| Err(std::io::Error::other(join_err)));
        crate::pane_ledger::surface_write_failure(state, &terminal_id_for_meta, result);
    }
```

(`terminal_id_for_meta` and `spec.cwd` are already in scope at that point — see `:1504-1510`; keep whatever local names the file actually uses. If `spec.cwd` is `Option<String>` cloning is direct; adapt if it is a `&str`/`PathBuf` shape.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Implement — exit/kill hygiene.** In the natural-exit `on_exit` hook (`terminal.rs:1305-1340`), clone the ledger alongside the other handles (`let pane_ledger = std::sync::Arc::clone(&state.pane_ledger);` next to `let identity = state.identity.clone();`) and inside the closure, after `identity.retire(&tid);`:

```rust
            // P1.8: an observed PTY exit in this epoch ends any
            // identity-in-flight window — the marker's job (distinguishing
            // fresh-by-race from fresh-by-intent across a SERVER death) is
            // over. Best-effort; never load-bearing. INLINE sync call is
            // correct HERE: the ExitHook (`pty.rs:55`, `FnOnce + Send`) runs
            // on the PTY's blocking/reader thread, not an async worker —
            // the one truly-synchronous ledger call site (V1.md).
            if let Err(err) = pane_ledger.delete_pending(&tid) {
                tracing::warn!(terminal_id = %tid, error = %err, "pane_ledger_marker_delete_failed_on_exit");
            }
```

The kill path: `kill_and_broadcast` (`terminal.rs:2106-2116`) is a SYNC fn invoked inline on the async dispatch task (`handle_kill`, `:2085-2087`) — do NOT put fsyncing ledger writes inside it (V1.md / A1). Instead, in `handle_kill`, after a successful `kill_and_broadcast(...)` and BEFORE returning, run the hygiene on the blocking pool and AWAIT it:

```rust
async fn handle_kill(kill: TerminalKill, ws_tx: &mut WsSink, state: &WsState) -> bool {
    if kill_and_broadcast(state, &kill.terminal_id) {
        // P1.8 trigger (e): explicit user close — best-effort retire of the
        // binding (`closed`) + marker cleanup. Best-effort by spec: SIGKILL
        // is the tested mode, so retire-on-close must never be load-bearing.
        // `session_ref_for` is retired-INCLUSIVE, so it still answers after
        // the retire() inside kill_and_broadcast. Awaited spawn_blocking:
        // fsync must not pin the dispatch task (V1.md; :1369-1379 precedent).
        let sref = state.identity.session_ref_for(&kill.terminal_id);
        let ledger = std::sync::Arc::clone(&state.pane_ledger);
        let tid = kill.terminal_id.clone();
        let now = now_ms();
        let _ = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || {
            if let Some(sref) = sref {
                if let Err(err) = ledger.retire_closed(&sref.provider, &sref.session_id, now) {
                    tracing::warn!(terminal_id = %tid, error = %err, "pane_ledger_retire_failed_on_kill");
                }
            }
            if let Err(err) = ledger.delete_pending(&tid) {
                tracing::warn!(terminal_id = %tid, error = %err, "pane_ledger_marker_delete_failed_on_kill");
            }
        })
        .await;
        return true;
    }
    // ... existing INVALID_TERMINAL_ID error reply, unchanged ...
}
```

Add `retire_closed` to `impl PaneLedger` in `pane_ledger.rs`:

```rust
    /// Best-effort retire on observed clean close (trigger e). Missing or
    /// already-retired rows are Ok — this path is never load-bearing.
    pub fn retire_closed(
        &self,
        provider: &str,
        session_id: &str,
        now_ms: i64,
    ) -> std::io::Result<()> {
        let Some(root) = &self.root else {
            return Ok(());
        };
        let mut index = self.guard();
        let Some(mut row) = index
            .bindings
            .get(&(provider.to_string(), session_id.to_string()))
            .cloned()
        else {
            return Ok(());
        };
        if row.state != RowState::Bound {
            return Ok(());
        }
        row.state = RowState::Retired;
        row.retired_reason = Some(RetiredReason::Closed);
        row.updated_at = now_ms;
        self.write_binding(root, &mut index, &row)
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run to verify pass.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test pane_ledger_triggers` then the full `cargo test -p freshell-ws` (existing suites must stay green — notably `claude_restore_unavailable.rs` and `codex_candidate_persisted.rs`). Expected: PASS.

### Task 7: Write-failure policy — `ledger-write-failure-surfaces-live` red test

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/pane_ledger_triggers.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 6's `surface_write_failure` wiring and `durability.degraded` frame.
- Produces: proof, on the wire, that the warning arrives at failure time and the create still succeeds.
- **Delivery semantics note (V8.md / A10 — accepted residual):** the broadcast bus is subscribe-before-handshake ordered (`lib.rs:512-515`) with capacity 1024, so the creating client receives the frame live; a `Lagged` receiver is closed LOUDLY (4008 "Backpressure", `terminal.rs:361-377`) so loss is never silent — but the lagged frame is NOT re-delivered after reconnect (the handshake does not resync durability state). Accepted for this slice. If strict per-client delivery is ever pinned, the upgrade path is a direct `ws_tx` send on the creating connection or degraded-state resync in the handshake.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test.** Append to `pane_ledger_triggers.rs`:

```rust
#[cfg(unix)]
#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]
async fn ledger_write_failure_surfaces_live_and_never_blocks_the_create() {
    // Red test `ledger-write-failure-surfaces-live` (spec §4.2): break the
    // store (read-only dir), create a claude pane. The create MUST succeed
    // (fail loud, degrade to status quo) and a `durability.degraded` frame
    // MUST arrive at failure time — before any restart could make the
    // warning posthumous.
    use std::os::unix::fs::PermissionsExt;
    let dir = unique_ledger_dir("write-fail");
    std::fs::set_permissions(&dir, std::fs::Permissions::from_mode(0o555)).unwrap();

    let (url, registry, _ledger_arc) =
        spawn_server_with_ledger(vec![sleeper_cli_spec("claude")], &dir).await;
    let (mut ws, _inv) = connect_and_capture_inventory(&url).await;

    let create = serde_json::json!({
        "type": "terminal.create",
        "requestId": "req-fail-1",
        "mode": "claude",
        "shell": "bash",
        "cwd": std::env::temp_dir().to_string_lossy(),
    });
    use futures_util::SinkExt;
    ws.send(tokio_tungstenite::tungstenite::Message::Text(create.to_string()))
        .await
        .unwrap();

    // Both frames arrive; capture order-independently (broadcast vs direct
    // send interleave). next_frame_of_type drops mismatches, so scan for
    // the degraded frame FIRST, then the created frame cannot have been
    // consumed... instead: collect frames until both seen.
    let mut created: Option<serde_json::Value> = None;
    let mut degraded: Option<serde_json::Value> = None;
    for _ in 0..20 {
        let frame = next_any_frame(&mut ws).await; // helper below
        match frame["type"].as_str() {
            Some("terminal.created") => created = Some(frame),
            Some("durability.degraded") => degraded = Some(frame),
            _ => {}
        }
        if created.is_some() && degraded.is_some() {
            break;
        }
    }
    let created = created.expect("create succeeded despite ledger failure");
    let degraded = degraded.expect("durability.degraded pushed LIVE at failure time");
    assert_eq!(degraded["reason"], "ledger_write_failed");
    assert_eq!(degraded["terminalId"], created["terminalId"]);

    let tid = created["terminalId"].as_str().unwrap();
    registry.kill(tid);
    std::fs::set_permissions(&dir, std::fs::Permissions::from_mode(0o755)).ok();
    std::fs::remove_dir_all(&dir).ok();
}
```

Add a small local helper at the top of the file (the harness's `next_frame_of_type` drops mismatched frames, which this test cannot afford):

```rust
async fn next_any_frame(
    ws: &mut tokio_tungstenite::WebSocketStream<
        tokio_tungstenite::MaybeTlsStream<tokio::net::TcpStream>,
    >,
) -> serde_json::Value {
    use futures_util::StreamExt;
    loop {
        let msg = tokio::time::timeout(std::time::Duration::from_secs(10), ws.next())
            .await
            .expect("frame within 10s")
            .expect("stream open")
            .expect("ws ok");
        if let tokio_tungstenite::tungstenite::Message::Text(text) = msg {
            return serde_json::from_str(&text).expect("json frame");
        }
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test pane_ledger_triggers ledger_write_failure` — Expected: with Task 6 fully done this may already PASS. If it passes immediately, deliberately break `surface_write_failure` (comment out the broadcast) and confirm the test FAILS for the right reason, then restore — the red run must prove the test can catch the regression.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify pass + full crate.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws` — Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: Refactor + gates.** `cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/tests/pane_ledger_triggers.rs
git commit -m "test(ws): ledger-write-failure-surfaces-live - degraded frame at failure time, create never blocked"
```

### Task 8: Codex candidate adoption → ledger resolution

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs` (the shared `ledger_resolve_identity` helper)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/codex_candidate.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/codex_candidate_persisted.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the adoption bind block `codex_candidate.rs:204-220` (`identity.upsert` → `registry.set_meta` → `broadcast_terminal_session_associated`), Task 3's `resolve_pending`, Task 6's `surface_write_failure`.
- Produces: `pub(crate) async fn ledger_resolve_identity(state: &crate::WsState, terminal_id: &str, provider: &str, session_id: &str, cwd: Option<&str>)` in `crate::pane_ledger` — the ONE resolution hook all three association modules share (Task 9 reuses it). It is `async` and wraps the fsyncing `resolve_pending` in an AWAITED `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` (V1.md / A1: resolution hooks run on async dispatch/sweep tasks; the write must not pin an async worker, and it must complete before the associated broadcast — durable-before-answer for resolution events).
- Signature change this task carries: `handle_codex_candidate_persisted` (`codex_candidate.rs:119`, currently a sync fn) becomes `pub(crate) async fn`, and its dispatch call site (`terminal.rs:486`) gains `.await` — the dispatch arm is already async context.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test.** `crates/freshell-ws/tests/codex_candidate_persisted.rs` runs a single sequential test (`codex_candidate_persisted_guards_and_happy_path`, `:143`) whose harness owns the process env. Extend it minimally:
  1. At the top of the test, before the server spawns, create a ledger dir and switch the spawn to the Task 5 harness variant: `let ledger_dir = std::env::temp_dir().join(format!("codex-adopt-ledger-{}", std::process::id())); std::fs::create_dir_all(&ledger_dir).unwrap();` and replace the `spawn_server_with_specs(...)` call with `spawn_server_with_ledger(<same specs>, &ledger_dir)` — note it returns a 3-tuple; bind the third element (`_server_ledger` if unused, since this test verifies via a fresh reader instance constructed AFTER the adoption). Also send the create with a pending-marker-producing shape (the existing fresh codex create already is one — no resume id).
  2. Immediately after the existing happy-path assertions (the pinned `terminal.session.associated` → `terminal.meta.updated` order + `registry_resume_id(...) == Some(THREAD_A)` block at `:232-247`), add:

```rust
    // P1.8: adoption is an identity event — the ledger must now hold a
    // binding row for THREAD_A, and the spawn-time pending marker must be
    // gone (binding-first pinned order, spec §4.2).
    let ledger = freshell_ws::pane_ledger::PaneLedger::new(Some(ledger_dir.clone()));
    let row = ledger
        .load_binding("codex", THREAD_A)
        .expect("adoption wrote a binding row");
    assert_eq!(row.state, freshell_ws::pane_ledger::RowState::Bound);
    assert_eq!(row.live_terminal_id.as_deref(), Some(tid.as_str()));
    assert!(
        ledger.pending_for_terminal(&tid).is_none(),
        "pending marker resolved away"
    );
    assert!(ledger.list_pending_raw().iter().all(|m| m.terminal_id != tid));
```

  (Use the test's actual local variable names for the terminal id and thread-id const.) Add `std::fs::remove_dir_all(&ledger_dir).ok();` to the test's existing cleanup tail.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test codex_candidate_persisted` — Expected: FAIL at `expect("adoption wrote a binding row")`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the shared helper.** In `crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs`:

```rust
/// The shared post-locator/candidate resolution hook (write trigger b/c):
/// binding row FIRST, then the pending marker is deleted (`resolve_pending`'s
/// pinned order). `create_request_id` is deliberately None here — it is an
/// advisory field captured at create time; resolution never joins on it (D4).
/// Failures never block the identity event; they surface LIVE.
///
/// `async` + awaited spawn_blocking (V1.md / A1): every caller is an async
/// dispatch/sweep task, and the fsyncing write (~15ms p50) must complete
/// BEFORE the associated broadcast without pinning an async worker.
pub(crate) async fn ledger_resolve_identity(
    state: &crate::WsState,
    terminal_id: &str,
    provider: &str,
    session_id: &str,
    cwd: Option<&str>,
) {
    let ledger = std::sync::Arc::clone(&state.pane_ledger);
    let provider_owned = provider.to_string();
    let session_id_owned = session_id.to_string();
    let terminal_id_owned = terminal_id.to_string();
    let cwd_owned = cwd.map(str::to_string);
    let now = crate::terminal::now_ms();
    let result = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || {
        ledger.resolve_pending(&BindingWrite {
            provider: &provider_owned,
            session_id: &session_id_owned,
            terminal_id: &terminal_id_owned,
            mode: &provider_owned,
            cwd: cwd_owned.as_deref(),
            create_request_id: None,
            now_ms: now,
        })
    })
    .await
    .unwrap_or_else(|join_err| Err(std::io::Error::other(join_err)));
    surface_write_failure(state, terminal_id, result);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Wire the codex hook.** First make the handler async (V1.md / A1 — the fsyncing resolution write must be awaited off the dispatch worker, and `spawn_blocking(...).await` needs an async context): change `pub(crate) fn handle_codex_candidate_persisted` (`codex_candidate.rs:119`) to `pub(crate) async fn`, and add `.await` at its single dispatch call site (`terminal.rs:486`, already inside the async dispatch match). Then, after the `state.registry.set_meta(...)` call (`:213-219`) and BEFORE `broadcast_terminal_session_associated` (`:220`):

```rust
    // P1.8 (trigger b): the verified adoption is an identity event — durable
    // binding row first, then the spawn-time pending marker is deleted.
    // Awaited spawn_blocking inside the helper: the fsync completes before
    // the associated broadcast, without pinning the dispatch worker (V1.md).
    crate::pane_ledger::ledger_resolve_identity(
        state,
        &msg.terminal_id,
        "codex",
        thread_id,
        row.cwd.as_deref(),
    )
    .await;
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run to verify pass.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test codex_candidate_persisted` then `cargo test -p freshell-ws`. Expected: PASS (rejected candidates must still write NOTHING — the guards all `return` before the hook, which the existing silence-proof phases keep pinned).

- [ ] **Step 6: Refactor + gates.** `cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit.**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/pane_ledger.rs crates/freshell-ws/src/codex_candidate.rs crates/freshell-ws/tests/codex_candidate_persisted.rs
git commit -m "feat(ws): codex candidate adoption writes the ledger binding + resolves the pending marker"
```

### Task 9: Opencode + amplifier locator resolution → ledger; P1.10 restore re-arm pinned

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/opencode_association.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/amplifier_association.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 8's `ledger_resolve_identity`; the opencode bind block (`opencode_association.rs:135-154`); the amplifier sibling's identical bind block (locate it in `amplifier_association.rs` — same `identity.upsert` → `set_meta` → broadcast shape); the in-file test fixture `state_with_locator` (`opencode_association.rs:220-282`).
- Produces: P1.10 behavior, pinned by test — a restore-created opencode pane that LACKS identity (restore:true with no sessionRef/resumeSessionId) arms the locator, carries a pending marker from spawn, and resolution lands the binding + deletes the marker.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** In `opencode_association.rs`'s `mod tests`:

  1. Extend `state_with_locator` with a ledger parameter — add a sibling fixture rather than churning every caller:

```rust
    fn state_with_locator_and_ledger(
        data_home: &std::path::Path,
        ledger_dir: &std::path::Path,
    ) -> (crate::WsState, tokio::sync::broadcast::Receiver<String>) {
        let (mut state, rx) = state_with_locator(data_home);
        state.pane_ledger = std::sync::Arc::new(crate::pane_ledger::PaneLedger::new(Some(
            ledger_dir.to_path_buf(),
        )));
        (state, rx)
    }
```

  2. Add the P1.10 pinning test, modeled line-for-line on `drain_and_associate_binds_identity_and_broadcasts_on_location` (`:406` — real PTY via `freshell_platform::build_spawn_spec` + `registry.create`, `set_meta` to opencode mode, `maybe_arm`, `note_possible_submit("\r")`, seeded sqlite `session` row, poll-drain up to 40×100ms):

```rust
    /// P1.10: a RESTORE-created opencode pane that lacks identity must
    /// still arm (restore:true suppresses arming ONLY via an implied
    /// resume_session_id — `OpencodeLocator::arm` checks the resume id,
    /// never a restore flag), and its identity-in-flight window must be
    /// covered by a durable pending marker until resolution deletes it.
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn restore_created_pane_without_identity_arms_and_resolves_into_the_ledger() {
        let home = unique_temp_dir("p110-restore-rearm");
        let ledger_dir = unique_temp_dir("p110-ledger");
        let (state, mut rx) = state_with_locator_and_ledger(&home, &ledger_dir);

        // ... spawn a real PTY registry row exactly as the sibling test
        // does (copy its registry.create + set_meta(mode "opencode",
        // resume None) setup verbatim; terminal id "t1") ...

        // The restore-shaped arm: identity absent, so resume is None — the
        // exact argument shape terminal.rs:1477-1483 produces for a
        // restore:true create that carried no sessionRef.
        maybe_arm(&state, "t1", "opencode", Some(cwd_str), None);
        assert_eq!(state.opencode_locator.as_ref().unwrap().armed_count(), 1);

        // The spawn-time pending marker (written by handle_create in
        // production — Task 6; written directly here because this test
        // drives the module, not the WS handler).
        state
            .pane_ledger
            .record_pending("t1", "opencode", Some(cwd_str), crate::terminal::now_ms())
            .unwrap();

        note_possible_submit(&state, "t1", "\r");
        // ... seed the sqlite session row for the cwd, as the sibling test
        // does, then poll drain_and_associate until identity binds ...

        // Resolution wrote the binding and deleted the marker (pinned order).
        let hit = state
            .pane_ledger
            .lookup_by_session("opencode", &located_session_id)
            .expect("binding row written at resolution");
        assert_eq!(hit.row.live_terminal_id.as_deref(), Some("t1"));
        assert!(state.pane_ledger.pending_for_terminal("t1").is_none());
        assert!(state.pane_ledger.list_pending_raw().is_empty());

        // ... sibling test's cleanup (registry.kill("t1"), remove dirs) ...
    }
```

  (Where the sketch says "copy … verbatim", copy from the sibling test in the same file — it is directly above. `armed_count` exists on the locator; if it is test-gated in `freshell-sessions`, assert arming the way `maybe_arm_arms_a_fresh_opencode_terminal` (`:356`) does instead.)

  3. Amplifier: add the mirror-image ledger assertion to `amplifier_association.rs`'s existing resolve-path test (find the sibling of `drain_and_associate_binds_identity_and_broadcasts_on_location` around `amplifier_association.rs:330-430`; extend its state fixture with a real ledger the same way and assert the binding row + marker deletion). If that file has no full resolve-path test (only `maybe_arm` tests), add the ledger assertion to a new test cloned from the opencode one, or — if a real amplifier resolve fixture is disproportionate — assert at minimum that `ledger_resolve_identity` is called by code inspection parity and cover amplifier's marker lifecycle via the Task 6 integration test (markers are written for the resolver allowlist modes — codex/opencode/amplifier — of which amplifier is one). Prefer the real test.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws opencode_association` — Expected: FAIL at `expect("binding row written at resolution")`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** In `opencode_association.rs`, inside `drain_and_associate`'s bind block, after `state.registry.set_meta(...)` (`:142-148`) and before `broadcast_terminal_session_associated` (`:149`):

```rust
        // P1.8 (trigger c) + P1.10: locator resolution is an identity event —
        // durable binding row first, then the spawn-time pending marker is
        // deleted. Registry-truth cwd, same as the in-memory binds above.
        // Awaited (drain_and_associate is async; the helper spawn_blockings
        // the fsync off this sweep task — V1.md).
        crate::pane_ledger::ledger_resolve_identity(
            state,
            &located.terminal_id,
            "opencode",
            &located.session_id,
            entry.cwd.as_deref(),
        )
        .await;
```

In `amplifier_association.rs`, add the identical `.await`ed call in its (equally async) bind block with provider `"amplifier"` and that block's registry-entry cwd (trigger (d) coherence: Task 6's `MARKER_MODES` allowlist writes markers for exactly codex/opencode/amplifier, so every allowlisted mode's resolver must also resolve the marker).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify pass.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws opencode_association && cargo test -p freshell-ws amplifier_association` then full `cargo test -p freshell-ws`. Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Refactor + gates.** `cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/opencode_association.rs crates/freshell-ws/src/amplifier_association.rs
git commit -m "feat(ws): opencode/amplifier locator resolution writes the ledger; pin P1.10 restore re-arm"
```

### Task 10: Read 1 — inventory sessionRef stamping falls back to the ledger

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/lib.rs` (`build_handshake_with_capabilities`, the stamping loop at `:398-403`)
- Create: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/pane_ledger_restore.rs` (first test)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1's `bound_session_ref_for_terminal`, Task 5's harness.
- Produces: inventory rows whose in-memory identity is absent are stamped from the ledger's bound rows (authority chain: in-memory registry → ledger bound rows).
- **Honesty note (V7.md / A21 — falsified as "non-dormant"):** no production window exists TODAY where a live terminal lacks in-memory identity while the ledger holds a bound row for its current terminalId — terminal ids are fresh UUIDs per create, and in-memory identity is written adjacent to every ledger write and survives retirement. Read 1 is a DEFENSIVE read whose mainline consumer arrives with Phase 3 / P1.13 (REST-created panes, verdict plumbing). It ships now because the authority-chain seam belongs in this slice; the test below FABRICATES the window (and says so in comments). The read is memory-only (index), so it costs nothing on the handshake path.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test.** Create `crates/freshell-ws/tests/pane_ledger_restore.rs`:

```rust
//! P1.8 read-side integration tests, exercised across server "generations"
//! sharing one ledger dir. Honesty (V7.md/V9.md): Read 1 (inventory
//! stamping) has NO production window today and its test FABRICATES one;
//! Read 3's ledger rung is production-reachable only via the orphaned
//! in-flight-create replay shape until P1.6 — comments on each test say
//! which. Read 2 (`ever_observed`) is live from day one.

### Task 11: Read 2 — `ever_observed` becomes ledger-backed

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` (probe construction)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `IndexExistenceProbe { index, observed }` (`freshell-server/src/existence.rs:28-32`), its `ever_observed` (`:88-93`), Task 1's `ever_bound`, Task 5's `pane_ledger` in `main.rs`.
- Produces: `IndexExistenceProbe::new(index: Arc<SessionIndex>, ledger: Option<Arc<freshell_ws::pane_ledger::PaneLedger>>)` (extend the existing constructor's signature; update its call sites). `ever_observed` returns `true` when the per-boot observed set OR the durable ledger has seen the identity. **Do not touch `reconcile.rs`** — the verdict derivation is unchanged; only this INPUT changes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test.** In `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` (create one if absent, following the file's conventions):

```rust
    #[test]
    fn ever_observed_survives_a_restart_via_the_ledger() {
        // Spec §4.2 read 2: a transcript deleted while the server was DOWN
        // must yield loud dead_session, not silent fresh. The per-boot
        // observed set is empty after a restart — the ledger is the durable
        // memory. (The Absent+ever_observed => dead_session derivation is
        // already pinned by reconcile.rs's
        // `row4_absent_but_ever_observed_yields_dead_session`; this test
        // covers the INPUT seam.)
        let dir = std::env::temp_dir().join(format!(
            "ledger-everobs-{}-{}",
            std::process::id(),
            std::time::SystemTime::now()
                .duration_since(std::time::UNIX_EPOCH)
                .map(|d| d.as_nanos())
                .unwrap_or(0)
        ));
        std::fs::create_dir_all(&dir).unwrap();
        let ledger = std::sync::Arc::new(freshell_ws::pane_ledger::PaneLedger::new(Some(
            dir.clone(),
        )));
        // "Generation 1" bound this identity durably.
        ledger
            .record_binding(&freshell_ws::pane_ledger::BindingWrite {
                provider: "claude",
                session_id: "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555",
                terminal_id: "t1",
                mode: "claude",
                cwd: None,
                create_request_id: None,
                now_ms: 1_000,
            })
            .unwrap();

        // "Generation 2": a brand-new probe with an EMPTY observed set —
        // construct it exactly as main.rs does, over an index whose
        // provider home is an empty temp dir (the transcript is gone).
        let probe = new_test_probe_with_ledger(Some(std::sync::Arc::clone(&ledger)));
        assert!(
            probe.ever_observed("claude", "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"),
            "durable ledger memory answers across restarts"
        );
        assert!(!probe.ever_observed("claude", "99999999-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"));

        // Without a ledger, the old per-boot behavior is preserved.
        let bare = new_test_probe_with_ledger(None);
        assert!(!bare.ever_observed("claude", "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"));
        std::fs::remove_dir_all(&dir).ok();
    }
```

Write `new_test_probe_with_ledger` following however the file's existing tests construct an `IndexExistenceProbe` (they exist for `exists()`; mirror their `SessionIndex` fixture). If no such fixture exists, construct the probe with a `SessionIndex` over an empty temp provider home.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure.** `cargo test -p freshell-server existence` — Expected: FAIL to compile (constructor has no ledger parameter) or assert-fail.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** In `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs`:

```rust
pub struct IndexExistenceProbe {
    index: Arc<SessionIndex>,
    /// `provider:sessionId` keys ever seen in ANY snapshot this boot.
    observed: Mutex<HashSet<String>>,
    /// P1.8 (spec §4.2 read 2): the durable "ever bound by this server"
    /// memory — survives restarts, so a transcript deleted while the server
    /// was down yields loud dead_session, not silent fresh.
    ledger: Option<Arc<freshell_ws::pane_ledger::PaneLedger>>,
}
```

Extend the constructor to accept `ledger: Option<Arc<PaneLedger>>` (store it; update every construction site — `main.rs` passes `Some(Arc::clone(&pane_ledger))`, tests pass what they need). Replace `ever_observed`:

```rust
    fn ever_observed(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> bool {
        if self
            .observed
            .lock()
            .expect("observed set lock")
            .contains(&format!("{provider}:{session_id}"))
        {
            return true;
        }
        self.ledger
            .as_ref()
            .is_some_and(|ledger| ledger.ever_bound(provider, session_id))
    }
```

In `main.rs`, construction order per Task 5: `pane_ledger` first, then the probe with the ledger handle, then the boot scan.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify pass.** `cargo test -p freshell-server && cargo test -p freshell-ws` — Expected: PASS (the `NoIndexProbe` used by all `freshell-ws` tests is untouched; `reconcile.rs` untouched).

- [ ] **Step 5: Refactor + gates.** `cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs
git commit -m "feat(server): ever_observed consults the pane ledger - deleted-while-down transcripts yield loud dead_session (P1.8 read 2)"
```

### Task 12: Read 3 — the claude restore ladder gains the durable-ledger rung

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs` (`resolve_claude_restore_session_id`, `:1568-1600`)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/pane_ledger_restore.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the existing ladder (rungs: identity registry → registry row, gated on newest-generation-not-Running, `terminal.rs:1581-1600` — its doc comment names this exact seam: "the durable-ledger and disk-scan rungs land in a later slice, P1.8"; the Running-gate documented at `terminal.rs:1574-1580` is PRESERVED), Task 1's `lookup_by_create_request_id`, Task 4's revive-on-rebind semantics, `registry.directory()` (`registry.rs:1402` — entries carry `mode`, `resume_session_id`, status).
- Produces: rung 3 — the ledger. Preserved judgments: (i) the A13 live-guard stays a HARD stop (a Running newest generation returns `None` before the ledger is consulted — the ledger must never reverse it); (ii) after an explicit user-kill IN THIS PROCESS, the binding is `retired/closed` (Task 6), which `lookup_by_create_request_id` excludes — the kill-then-restore case still fails loud; (iii) **NEW, V6.md/A13:** the ledger rung's live-guard additionally scans REGISTRY rows — a claude resumed via the freshagent REST API is invisible to BOTH `identity.find_by_session` (never upserted) AND createRequestId lineage (REST mints none); its only footprint is a registry row with `mode=="claude" && resume_session_id==<id> && status Running`. Without the registry scan, the rung would green-light a double resume.
- **Honesty (V9.md / A11 — production reach):** the mainline browser-closed / cleared-client restore RE-MINTS `createRequestId` before any create (`panesSlice.ts:525-549`, `TerminalView.tsx:4198/:4255`, `stripStaleIds` `:815-819`) — for that shape this rung is dormant until P1.6 stabilizes the key. The rung IS production-reachable today via one narrow real shape: an orphaned in-flight create (pane never anchored — no terminalId, status 'creating') replays the SAME persisted id across reconnect AND across browser close (`TerminalView.tsx:4309-4333`; `persistMiddleware.ts:229` preserves it). This is consistent with the spec's "NOT keyed on createRequestId (advisory)" ruling: the rung is an advisory LOOKUP over a stored advisory field — never an identity join key; binding rows stay keyed on sessionRef.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test.** Append to `crates/freshell-ws/tests/pane_ledger_restore.rs`:

```rust
#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]
async fn claude_restore_resolves_via_the_ledger_across_a_restart() {
    // The P1.8 ladder rung: generation 1 pre-allocates a claude session id
    // and durably records it; generation 2 (fresh process state) receives
    // restore:true with ONLY the createRequestId and must auto-resume via
    // the ledger instead of rejecting with RESTORE_UNAVAILABLE.
    //
    // HONESTY (V9.md / A11): the production shape that presents the SAME
    // createRequestId across a restart is the ORPHANED IN-FLIGHT CREATE
    // (pane never anchored — no terminalId — replays its persisted id,
    // TerminalView.tsx:4309-4333 / persistMiddleware.ts:229). The mainline
    // browser-closed/cleared-client restores RE-MINT the id and stay on
    // RESTORE_UNAVAILABLE until P1.6. This test's wire shape matches the
    // orphaned-create replay; the rung is an advisory lookup, never an
    // identity join key (spec: "NOT keyed on createRequestId").

(Mirror the exact error-frame field spelling from `crates/freshell-ws/tests/claude_restore_unavailable.rs` — copy its assertion shape. For the REST-shaped row, adapt the `registry.create`/`set_meta` calls to their actual signatures — the essentials are: a Running row, `mode=="claude"`, `resume_session_id==SESSION`, no identity upsert, no createRequestId.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test pane_ledger_restore` — Expected: `claude_restore_resolves_via_the_ledger_across_a_restart` FAILS (generation 2 answers `error{RESTORE_UNAVAILABLE}`) and `claude_restore_is_refused_while_a_rest_shaped_live_claude_owns_the_session` FAILS THE OTHER WAY once the rung exists without the registry scan — run it again after Step 3's first cut if you build the rung incrementally; in the red state (no rung at all) it passes vacuously, so its true red run is against a rung WITHOUT the registry-scan guard (comment the guard out once, watch it fail, restore — the Task 7 discipline). The `closed` test may already pass (it pins existing judgment — keep it).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** Replace `resolve_claude_restore_session_id` (`terminal.rs:1581-1600`) with (keep the existing doc comment, updating its "land in a later slice, P1.8" sentence to note the ledger rung now exists and only the disk-scan rung remains future):

```rust
fn resolve_claude_restore_session_id(state: &WsState, create_request_id: &str) -> Option<String> {
    // Rungs 1-2 (in-process, PR #530) — unchanged, except the early-return
    // structure now falls THROUGH to the ledger when the in-process homes
    // simply have no lineage (a fresh boot), while the A13 live-guard stays
    // a HARD stop the ledger must never reverse.
    if let Some(newest) = state.registry.newest_by_create_request_id(create_request_id) {
        if let Some(row) = state.registry.probe(&newest) {
            if row.status == freshell_protocol::TerminalRunStatus::Running {
                return None; // A13 live-guard: never a second live claude on one session id
            }
            if let Some(sref) = state.identity.session_ref_for(&newest) {
                // Retired entries included -- an exited claude's identity is
                // exactly what a same-lineage restore needs.
                if sref.provider == "claude" {
                    return Some(sref.session_id);
                }
            }

                if let Some(sid) = row.resume_session_id.filter(|s| !s.is_empty()) {
                    return Some(sid);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    // Rung 3 (P1.8): the durable ledger — the rung that survives restarts.
    // `lookup_by_create_request_id` answers only `bound` rows and
    // `gc_expired` tombstones (auto-resume is a legal transition); a row
    // retired `closed` (user-kill) or `superseded` is never resurrected.
    // The lookup is memory-only (write-through index) — cheap inline.
    let row = state
        .pane_ledger
        .lookup_by_create_request_id("claude", create_request_id)?;
    // A13-equivalent guard, part 1: if ANY live identity-registry entry
    // currently owns this session id, fail loud rather than double-resume.
    if let Some(owner) = state.identity.find_by_session("claude", &row.session_id) {
        if state

        {
            return None;
        }
    }
    // A13-equivalent guard, part 2 (V6.md): REST-resumed claudes are
    // invisible to the identity registry AND to createRequestId lineage —
    // their only footprint is a registry row {mode:"claude",
    // resume_session_id, Running}. Scan the live registry so the ledger
    // rung can never green-light a second live claude on one session id.
    let rest_shaped_live = state.registry.directory().into_iter().any(|entry| {
        entry.mode.as_deref() == Some("claude")
            && entry.resume_session_id.as_deref() == Some(row.session_id.as_str())
            && entry.status == freshell_protocol::TerminalRunStatus::Running
    });
    if rest_shaped_live {
        tracing::warn!(
            target: "freshell_ws::pane_ledger",
            session_id = %row.session_id,
            "claude_restore_refused: a live (REST-shaped) claude already owns this session id"
        );
        return None;
    }
    if row.retired_reason == Some(crate::pane_ledger::RetiredReason::GcExpired) {
        tracing::info!(
            target: "freshell_ws::pane_ledger",
            session_id = %row.session_id,
            "pane_ledger_auto_resume: gc_expired tombstone revived by restore (never-ask-when-we-can-act)"
        );
    }
    Some(row.session_id)
}
```

(`find_by_session` returns `Option<TerminalIdentity>` — `identity.rs:157-166`, live-only, which is exactly part 1's need. For part 2, adapt the field access to `registry.directory()`'s actual entry shape — `registry.rs:1402`; entries carry `mode`, `resume_session_id` (e.g. `registry.rs:1340,1420,1571`) and a run status. If cloning the whole directory proves heavy, add a dedicated `registry.find_running_by_resume_session_id(mode, sid) -> bool` finder instead — same semantics. Note the pre-existing rung-1/2 Running-gate (`terminal.rs:1574-1580`) is untouched above.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify pass.** `cargo test -p freshell-ws --test pane_ledger_restore` then FULL `cargo test -p freshell-ws` — `claude_restore_unavailable.rs` (the PR #530 contract) must stay green: its unresolvable cases use identities the ledger has never seen, so the new rung returns `None` and the loud reject is preserved. Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Refactor + gates.** `cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs crates/freshell-ws/tests/pane_ledger_restore.rs
git commit -m "feat(ws): claude restore ladder gains the durable-ledger rung (P1.8 read 3)"

### Task 13: E2E — SIGKILL durability walls

**Files:**
- Create: `test/e2e-browser/specs/pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts`
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts` (register in BOTH `RUST_ONLY_SPECS` and `rust-chromium`'s `testMatch` — missing either means the spec fails under `chromium` or never runs)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `RustServer` (`test/e2e-browser/helpers/rust-server.ts` — `findFreePort()`, mkdtemp'd `$HOME`, `.start()/.restartAbrupt()/.stop()`), `TestHarness`, `openPanePicker` (`helpers/pane-picker.ts`), fake CLIs (`fixtures/fake-claude-cli.mjs`, `fake-codex-cli.mjs`, `fake-opencode-terminal.mjs`) via `CLAUDE_CMD`/`CODEX_CMD`/`OPENCODE_CMD` + copy-then-chmod. Per this suite's per-spec-ownership convention, small helpers are COPIED from `compound-restart-rust.spec.ts`, not imported.
- Produces: the e2e shapes of `SIGKILL-within-5s-of-pane-creation` and `SIGKILL-inside-locator-window`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing spec.** Create `test/e2e-browser/specs/pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * P1.8 pane-identity ledger — SIGKILL durability walls (spec §4.2).
 *
 * Wall 1 (`SIGKILL-within-5s-of-pane-creation`): by the time a pane exists,
 * its identity row (or pending marker) is on disk — an abrupt SIGKILL
 * moments after creation loses nothing, and the restarted server's boot
 * scan preserves (never quarantines, never sweeps) the evidence.
 *
 * Wall 2 (`SIGKILL-inside-locator-window`): a pane killed mid
 * identity-establishment leaves a durable pending marker that SURVIVES the
 * restart boot scan — fresh-by-race stays distinguishable from
 * fresh-by-intent.
 *
 * Fixture shapes (fake CLIs, temp-home seeding, restart choreography)
 * mirror compound-restart-rust.spec.ts; helpers are copied, not imported,
 * per this suite's per-spec-ownership convention.

Implementer notes (bindings to reality — reconcile each against the named source before first run; V12.md verified the load-bearing ones):
  - Copy the exact `test`/`expect` import + fixture line from `compound-restart-rust.spec.ts` (`fixtures-or-base.js` above is a placeholder for whatever that spec imports).
  - `RustServer`'s option names (`env`, `setupHome`) and `restartAbrupt()` are as used at `compound-restart-rust.spec.ts:275-298`; `restartAbrupt()` reboots on the SAME home/port/token (`rust-server.ts:344-378`), which is why the browser's WS auto-reconnect recovers without a reload.
  - **Picker buttons render ONLY when the `availableClis` gate passes** (`PanePicker.tsx:117`) — server-side CLI detection honors the `*_CMD` env overrides, so the `CLAUDE_CMD`/`CODEX_CMD`/`OPENCODE_CMD` values in `RustServer({ env })` above are load-bearing, not decorative (V12.md). Button names come from extension manifest labels: `/^Claude CLI$/i`, `/^Codex CLI$/i`, `/^OpenCode$/i`. The directory-combobox locators are fine as written (unanchored `/Starting directory/i` matches "Starting directory for Claude CLI" etc.).
  - `getWsReadyState` exists on `window.__FRESHELL_TEST_HARNESS__` ONLY when the page loads with `e2e=1` (V12.md/A19a) — both `page.goto` calls above include it; match `compound-restart-rust.spec.ts:298-303`'s post-restart choreography verbatim.
  - Wall 2's `FAKE_OPENCODE_TERMINAL_ROW_GATE_PATH` must point at a file that is NEVER created (see the in-spec comment) — without it the fake writes its sqlite identity row on first stdin data and the "identity never resolves" premise races the SIGKILL.
  - If `fs.readdir(..., { recursive: true })` is unavailable on the repo's Node version, replace `listFiles` with a small manual walk.
  - After a pane-picker create, dismiss/settle any picker state the same way sibling specs do (`selectShellIfPickerShowing` pattern) if the second `openCliPane` cannot find the picker.

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the spec.** In `test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts`, add `'pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts'` to `RUST_ONLY_SPECS` AND to the `rust-chromium` project's `testMatch`, following exactly how `compound-restart-rust.spec.ts` appears in both.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run to verify.** Run: `npm run test:e2e -- --project=rust-chromium -g "pane-identity ledger"`
Expected: PASS (the Rust side already exists by this task). If either test fails, the failure is REAL signal about the wiring — debug the server side, do not weaken the assertions. (Playwright e2e is not coordinator-gated.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit.**

```bash
git add test/e2e-browser/specs/pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts
git commit -m "test(e2e): SIGKILL durability walls for the pane-identity ledger"
```

---

### Task 14: Full verification + push

**Files:** none new (fixes only, if gates fail).

- [ ] **Step 1: Rust gates.**

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

Expected: all green (generous timeout for `cargo test --workspace` — real PTY spawns).

- [ ] **Step 2: Coordinated JS suite** (we touched only e2e TS, but the repo rule is both-coverage + green gates before hand-off):

```bash
npm run test:status   # inspect the holder; WAIT if a sibling lane holds the gate
FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY="pane-identity-ledger lane A3 verification" npm test
```

Expected: green (or pre-existing failures documented as such against the base — do not paper over anything this branch caused).

- [ ] **Step 3: E2E.**

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --project=rust-chromium -g "pane-identity ledger"
```

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: Push the branch. STOP before any PR.**

```bash
git push -u origin feat/pane-identity-ledger
```

PR creation is NOT approved — report the branch name and the proof (test outputs) instead.

## Spec coverage map (self-review record)

| Spec §4.2 pinned rule | Covering task(s) |
|---|---|
| Two row types, different keys/rights; markers never promoted/joined (G1) | 1, 3 |
| Pinned order: binding row FIRST, then marker delete; idempotent resolution | 3 (tests: `resolve_pending_writes_binding_first…`, `pending_resolution_collision…`) |
| Marker readable exactly-one-read by terminalId; binding-row-wins reader rule | 3 |
| Markers GC'd on observed clean exit in-epoch; never swept at boot MERELY for not-live (crash-residue + TTL-aged sweeps are the two loud exceptions — V7.md leaked-marker bound) | 4 (`boot_scan_never_sweeps…`, `aged_out_marker…`), 6 (exit/kill deletion) |
| Supersession retires-never-defends; new bound FIRST then retire; boot repair + tiebreak | 2, 4 |
| Reader follows `supersededBy` chain to terminus, `corrected:true`; no cycles | 2 (verdict-level wiring is Phase 3, stated in Global Constraints) |
| GC-to-tombstone; `gc_expired → bound` legal + auto + loud; tombstone delete conditioned on transcript absence via DIRECT filesystem stat by provider path convention (never probe Absent alone — V10.md) | 4, 5 (the direct-stat closure), 12 (auto-resume rung) |
| Corruption quarantine: per-row rename-aside + ERROR, healthy rows served, API surface | 4 (`corrupt_ledger_boot…`; verdict breadcrumb is Phase 3, stated) |
| Write-failure: never blocks, live frame at failure time + ERROR + counter | 6, 7 |
| Atomic temp+rename per row; `ledgerVersion` field gates migration | 1, 4 |
| Precedence: in-memory registry → ledger bound rows (→ client claim → snapshot) | 10 (the two server-side rungs; the client-claim/snapshot rungs live in reconcile, Phase 3) |
| Write triggers: (a) claude pre-allocation, (b) codex adoption, (c) opencode resolution, (d) pending at spawn — RESOLVER ALLOWLIST codex/opencode/amplifier only (V5.md/V7.md), (e) retire on close. WS `handle_create` only; REST/freshagent creates deferred to P1.13 (Global Constraints; V6.md) | 6, 8, 9 |
| Reads ship in-slice: inventory stamping (defensive — window fabricated in test, mainline consumer P1.13, V7.md), `ever_observed` (live day one), claude ladder rung (production-reachable via orphaned in-flight-create replay; mainline restore shapes re-mint the id until P1.6, V9.md) | 10, 11, 12 |
| Async-path writes via awaited `spawn_blocking` (durable-before-answer preserved); reads memory-only via write-through index | 1 (index), 5 (boot/GC), 6, 8, 9 (V1.md) |
| Single-writer store guard (exclusive flock, disabled-on-conflict) | 1 (`new_locked` + unit test), 5 (main.rs wiring) (V2.md) |
| Resume-invocation record (terminal panes: provider/sessionId/mode/cwd) | 1 (schema), Global Constraints (P1.13 boundary for freshagent settings) |
| P1.10: restore-created opencode w/o identity arms + pending marker until resolution | 9 (+6 for the marker) |
| Red tests named by the task | mapping table in File Structure section |
| E2E: SIGKILL walls on own RustServer, ephemeral ports | 13; browser-closed/cleared-client variant is delivered as the two-generation fresh-connection integration tests (10, 12) because the frozen client cannot express verdict-driven recovery until Phase 3 — the server-side behavior ("inventory stamping can still resolve", ladder resolution with only a requestId) is fully proven |

No placeholder patterns remain (checked for TBD/TODO/"handle edge cases"/"similar to Task N"); type names cross-checked: `PaneLedger`, `LedgerIndex`, `BindingRow`, `BindingWrite`, `RowState`, `RetiredReason`, `PendingMarker`, `Resolution`, `QuarantinedRow`, `BootScanReport`, `MARKER_MODES`, `PENDING_MARKER_TTL_MS`, `new`, `new_locked`, `record_binding`, `record_pending`, `resolve_pending`, `delete_pending`, `pending_for_terminal`, `list_pending_raw`, `retire_closed`, `ever_bound`, `load_binding`, `list_bindings`, `lookup_by_session`, `lookup_by_create_request_id`, `bound_session_ref_for_terminal`, `boot_scan`, `gc`, `quarantined_rows`, `surface_write_failure`, `ledger_resolve_identity` (async), `transcript_definitively_absent` are used consistently across Tasks 1–13.
