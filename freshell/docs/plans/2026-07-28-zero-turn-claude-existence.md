**Goal:** Zero-turn freshclaude sessions (0-byte transcript that exists on disk) must reconcile to `respawn` after an abrupt server restart — never be falsely adjudicated `dead_session` — while genuinely-deleted transcripts still fire the loud `dead_session` hazard guard.

**Architecture:** freshell has two silently inconsistent definitions of "does this claude session exist": the attach/resume arm trusts raw file existence (`crates/freshell-freshagent/src/claude_snapshot.rs::locate_transcript`), while the reconcile-verdict arm consults the warm `SessionIndex`, whose R10b gate (`meta.cwd.as_ref()?` in `crates/freshell-sessions/src/directory_index.rs::parse_claude_file`) excludes any transcript with no parseable cwd line — so a 0-byte zero-turn transcript is confidently reported `Absent`, combined with the ledger's `ever_observed=true` into `GoneObserved` → `DeadSession{session_not_on_disk}`. The fix makes the two arms agree WITHOUT weakening R10b (History still needs real displayable metadata) and WITHOUT touching codex: `IndexExistenceProbe` (in `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs`) gains an injected claude-transcript-locator closure; when the warm index answers `Absent` for provider `"claude"`, the probe consults the same raw-file check the attach arm uses before finalizing `Absent` — file exists ⇒ `Present`. `main.rs` injects `freshell_freshagent::locate_transcript` at wiring time (the same injectable-locator pattern as `codex_rollout_locator`), keeping the probe unit-testable with a fake locator and no env manipulation.

**Root cause is PROVEN** (instrumented traces from a systematic-debugging investigation; existence=Absent for a 0-byte transcript on disk with a bound ledger row). Do not re-litigate it; Task 1's RED runs and Task 2's RED unit test are the load-bearing verification of its claims. Note: `kilroy` is a sessionType that maps to provider `"claude"` (same transcript store), so a claude-scoped fix covers it for free. Two alternative shapes were evaluated and rejected: (a) splitting the probe into two methods, "valid listable session" (History, keeps R10b) vs "identity exists on disk" (reconcile, stat-only) — would require a second trait method on `SessionExistenceProbe` and touch every implementor/caller for a distinction only claude needs; the injected fallback is strictly smaller and keeps the trait contract intact. (b) a distinct `PresentUnparsed` variant instead of plain `Present` — rejected because no downstream consumer needs the distinction: `build_snapshot` (`crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile_freshagent.rs`) maps `E::Present` → `FreshAgentPresence::OnDisk` → verdict `respawn`, which is exactly the desired outcome, and every `SessionExistence` match in that module is deliberately exhaustive with no catch-all — a new variant would force edits (and re-decisions) at every match site for zero behavioral difference.

**Tech Stack:** Rust (cargo workspace: `freshell-server`, `freshell-ws`, `freshell-freshagent`, `freshell-sessions`), Playwright e2e (`test/e2e-browser/`, rust-chromium project), fake claude sidecar fixture (`test/e2e-browser/fixtures/fake-claude-sidecar.mjs`).

## Global Constraints

- Worktree: `/home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/zero-turn-claude-existence`, branch `fix/zero-turn-claude-existence`, based on current `origin/main` (≥ `53673c2c`). ALL commands below run from this worktree root unless stated otherwise.
- NEVER use ports 3001/3002 (the user's LIVE servers — 3002 is the live Rust server). NEVER restart the user's server. NEVER use broad kill patterns (`pkill -f ...`, `pkill node`). E2e fixtures pick ephemeral ports themselves — never pass a fixed port.
- Broad test runs go through the shared coordinator gate: check `npm run test:status` first; if another agent holds it, WAIT — never kill a foreign holder. Canonical broad-run form: `FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY="kata 09v1 zero-turn-claude-existence <phase>" env -u FRESHELL_BIND_HOST npm test`.
- CI gates that must pass: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` (required CI), `cargo test --workspace`, coordinated `npm test`, `npm run test:port`.
- After ANY Rust edit, rebuild explicitly with `cargo build --release -p freshell-server` before running e2e — the e2e harness only auto-builds when `target/release/freshell-server` is MISSING; it does not detect staleness.
- Do NOT weaken R10b (`meta.cwd.as_ref()?` in `directory_index.rs:291` and its byte-for-byte mirror in `crates/freshell-server/src/session_directory.rs`) — it protects the History sidebar. Do NOT change codex behavior (zero-turn codex genuinely has no rollout file).
- Do NOT build on the scratch worktree `.worktrees/debug-09v1` (branch `debug/09v1`) and do NOT let its `DEBUG09v1`-marked `eprintln!`s leak into this branch. It is read-only evidence, as are `/tmp/09v1-server-stderr.log`, `/tmp/freshell-e2e-rust-NaUAAO/`, `/tmp/09v1-test-run*.log`.
- PR POLICY: do NOT create a PR. Push the branch and stop; landing happens outside this workflow.
- Git identity: commits use `Dan Shapiro <3732858+danshapiro@users.noreply.github.com>` (already configured — do not override; never write `dan@danshapiro.com` into git config).
- Server TS is NodeNext/ESM: relative imports in `.ts` files must include `.js` extensions.
- README.md is the only end-user markdown doc; this plan under `docs/plans/` is a working/agent doc.
- Keep commits focused and atomic; Red-Green-Refactor for every behavior change.

## File Structure

| File | Action | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs` | Modify | `IndexExistenceProbe`: new optional `claude_transcript_locator` field + builder setter; warm-`Absent` fallback for provider `"claude"`; observed-set feed on fallback hit; module-doc bullet; unit tests (RED→GREEN) |
| `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/claude_snapshot.rs` | Modify | `locate_transcript`: `pub(crate)` → `pub`, doc updated for the new consumer (everything else stays `pub(crate)`) |
| `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/lib.rs` | Modify | Narrow re-export: `pub use claude_snapshot::locate_transcript;` |
| `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` | Modify | Wire the real locator into the probe at the single construction site (~`:570`) |
| `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile_freshagent.rs` | Modify | Module doc (`:8-18`): add the claude zero-turn asymmetry bullet; update the CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR WATCH bullet |
| `test/e2e-browser/specs/freshclaude-zero-turn-restart-rust.spec.ts` | Create | NEW companion e2e: VISIBLE zero-turn freshclaude pane survives abrupt restart |
| `test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts` | Modify | Register the new spec in `RUST_ONLY_SPECS` (~`:81-155`) AND `rust-chromium.testMatch` (~`:208-337`) |
| `test/e2e-browser/helpers/test-server.ts` | Modify | `applyIsolatedHomeEnvironment`: delete `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (isolation guard — the fix makes reconcile verdicts newly depend on that root) |

Crate dependency note (verified): `freshell-server` already depends on `freshell-freshagent` (`crates/freshell-server/Cargo.toml`, `freshell-freshagent = { path = "../freshell-freshagent" }`), so no cross-crate injection trait is needed — only a visibility promotion. The closure injection into the probe is for decoupling + testability (precedent: `codex_rollout_locator` at `main.rs:482-486`), not to satisfy the dependency graph.

Root-set note (deliberate behavior change, called out for reviewers): the index-backed probe today sees ONE claude root (`CLAUDE_HOME` else `$HOME/.claude` via `session_directory::claude_home`); `locate_transcript` scans the attach arm's full ordered candidate set (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` > `CLAUDE_HOME` > `$HOME/.claude`, env-resolved at call time, deduped). Adopting the attach arm's set is the point — the two arms must agree — and it incidentally closes the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` reader/writer-split WATCH declared in `reconcile_freshagent.rs:17-18` for the reconcile arm (the History index walk still reads one root). Task 5 updates that WATCH comment.

**Validated-reality note (load-bearing validation, 2026-07-28 — see `.worktrees/.the-usual-logs/zero-turn-claude-existence/load-bearing-ledger.md`):** two claims the plan originally asserted were tested against the REAL claude CLI (2.1.220) and the REAL production sidecar (`crates/freshell-claude-sidecar/index.mjs` + `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) in a blackholed sandbox, and both are **false**: (a) the real CLI does NOT create the transcript file at session create — it materializes the file (and the durable UUID via `sdk.session.init`) only at the FIRST TURN; (b) `claude --resume` (uuid or path form, `-p` or interactive) REJECTS a 0-byte transcript ("No conversation found…", exit 1, prompt exit — it never silently starts a new session). Consequences for this plan: the create-time 0-byte transcript is a shape constructed by the E2E FIXTURE (which also mints the durable identity); the nearest production-reachable shapes are crash-window partial/cwd-less transcripts — i.e. the broader class "on disk but R10b-excluded", which this fix also covers. The fix's mechanism and target verdict are UNCHANGED (the kata's acceptance e2e fixes the verdict at respawn, and under the fixture resume succeeds), but the justifying invariant is corrected to: **reconcile must never adjudicate dead an on-disk transcript the attach arm would attempt to resume; if a respawn genuinely cannot succeed, the pane converges to the honest, bounded `dead_session{respawn_exhausted}` via the respawn cap** (prompt-exit on failed resume verified, so the cap always converges). No plan text, code comment, or commit message may assert "the real CLI creates the transcript at session create" or "a 0-byte transcript is resumable" — tasks below were rewritten accordingly.

**Consumer/failure-mode note (deliberate behavior changes, called out for reviewers):** the probe is shared by BOTH verdict arms, so the fallback also changes the TERMINAL arm (`crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs:274`): a terminal claude pane bound to a zero-turn session flips from `dead_session{session_not_on_disk}` to `respawn` (PTY relaunch `claude --resume <id>`) — the same attach-arm agreement this fix exists to create; no existing test pins the old terminal shape (reconcile.rs unit tests inject explicit probe answers; the reconcile-handshake dead-session e2e deletes the file, which still answers Absent). Second, zero-turn claude moves from the no-burn branch into the respawn-cap branch (stage-1 survey §4d, accepted deliberately): a pane whose respawn repeatedly fails now converges to `dead_session{respawn_exhausted}` after `FRESH_AGENT_RESPAWN_CAP` (=3) burned answers (terminal arm: the registry's §7.5 generation cap) instead of an instant-but-false `session_not_on_disk`. The loud immediate guard is unchanged for genuinely-deleted transcripts (Task 2's `genuinely_missing_transcript_stays_absent_with_locator_installed`). Do NOT exempt fallback hits from the burn — that would reopen unbounded respawn thrash for unresumable sessions.

**Perf note (measured):** the sync `locate_transcript` walk inside `exists()` was benchmarked against the real store (87 project dirs / 2096 transcripts, ext4 WSL2): worst-case MISS across 3 roots p50=2.8ms / p95=4.1ms, and recurrence is bounded (reconcile is client-request-driven with no re-derivation loop). No caching needed now; if a store grows ~10×, negative caching in the locator closure is the pre-identified escape hatch.

### Task 1: Workspace verification + RED baseline (proves the diagnosis end-to-end)

**Files:**
- No source changes. Produces `/tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server` (a saved copy of the pre-fix release binary, used by Task 6 for the companion e2e's red-proof).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: a green base suite record, a pre-fix release binary at `/tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server`, and a recorded RED failure of the kata's acceptance e2e.

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify the worktree is on current origin/main**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/zero-turn-claude-existence
git fetch origin
git log --oneline -1 origin/main
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD && echo BASE-OK || echo "REBASE NEEDED"
git status --short
```
Expected: `BASE-OK` (origin/main is `53673c2c` or newer and an ancestor of HEAD). If `REBASE NEEDED`: `git rebase origin/main` (the branch has only this plan committed, so it rebases trivially).

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify node_modules and the tsx symlink**

Run:
```bash
ls node_modules/tsx >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo TSX-OK || { npm ci && ln -s ../node_modules/tsx node_modules/tsx 2>/dev/null; echo TSX-FIXED; }
```
Expected: `TSX-OK` (already verified present at plan-writing time) or `TSX-FIXED`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Base suite green (coordinated broad run)**

Run:
```bash
npm run test:status
```
If another agent holds the coordinator gate: WAIT (poll `npm run test:status` every few minutes) — never kill a foreign holder. Then:
```bash
FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY="kata 09v1 zero-turn-claude-existence base green" env -u FRESHELL_BIND_HOST npm test
```
Expected: PASS. If the base suite is red on unmodified origin/main, STOP and report the failing command + summary — do not proceed on a red base.

- [ ] **Step 4: Build the pre-fix release binary and save a copy**

Run:
```bash
cargo build --release -p freshell-server
cp target/release/freshell-server /tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server
chmod +x /tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server
```
Expected: build succeeds; `/tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server` exists and is executable. This frozen pre-fix binary is Task 6's red-proof lever for the new companion spec (`FRESHELL_E2E_RUST_SERVER_BIN` fails closed if it is not an executable file).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the kata's acceptance e2e AS-IS and record the RED**

The acceptance test is `test/e2e-browser/specs/hidden-pane-rebind-rust.spec.ts` test `'hidden fresh-agent pane recovers after abrupt restart without reveal'`. It creates a freshclaude pane via the fake sidecar (which creates a **0-byte transcript at session create** — `fake-claude-sidecar.mjs` runs `fs.closeSync(fs.openSync(transcriptPath(cliSessionId), 'a'))` on `create`; `appendTranscript` only runs on `send`), sends NO turn, hides the pane, `restartAbrupt()`s the server, and polls for a sidecar-log `create` carrying `resumeSessionId === originalDurable`. Do NOT add a turn to it — zero-turn is the point.

Run:
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --project=rust-chromium specs/hidden-pane-rebind-rust.spec.ts -g 'hidden fresh-agent pane recovers'
```
Expected: **FAIL** (timeout on the resumed-poll — the server adjudicates the zero-turn session `dead_session{session_not_on_disk}` instead of `respawn`, so the resume `create` never appears in the sidecar log). This RED run is the end-to-end verification of the diagnosis. If it PASSES, STOP: the bug is already fixed on main — report and halt rather than proceeding.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit (nothing to commit — record only)**

No commit for this task (no file changes). Record the RED output (the failing assertion text) in the task report for the reviewer.

---

### Task 2: Probe fallback in `IndexExistenceProbe` (RED unit tests → implementation → GREEN)

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: existing `IndexExistenceProbe { index, observed, ledger, provider_roots }`, `SessionExistence::{Present, Absent, Unknown, ProviderUnavailable}` and `SessionExistenceProbe` (both from `crates/freshell-ws/src/existence.rs`), test helpers `temp_claude_home(tag: &str) -> PathBuf`, `write_session(claude_home: &Path, session_id: &str)`, `probe_over(home: &Path) -> (IndexExistenceProbe, Arc<SessionIndex>)` (all already in `existence.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`).
- Produces (Tasks 3 and 6 rely on these exact names/types):
  - `pub type ClaudeTranscriptLocator = std::sync::Arc<dyn Fn(&str) -> Option<std::path::PathBuf> + Send + Sync>;`
  - `impl IndexExistenceProbe { pub fn with_claude_transcript_locator(self, locator: ClaudeTranscriptLocator) -> Self }` (builder-style, consumes and returns `Self`; no change to `IndexExistenceProbe::new`'s signature — existing call sites stay untouched).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append inside the existing `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block of `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs` (after the existing helper fns `temp_claude_home` / `write_session` / `probe_over` / `new_test_probe_with_ledger`; `use super::*;` is already at the top of the module, which brings `Arc`, `HashMap`, `PathBuf`, and — once Step 3 lands — `ClaudeTranscriptLocator` into scope):

```rust

    /// the transcript only at first turn and rejects resume of a 0-byte file;

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-server existence
```
Expected: **compile error** — `with_claude_transcript_locator` and `ClaudeTranscriptLocator` do not exist yet. That compile failure is the first RED. To also capture the BEHAVIORAL red (the load-bearing verification of the diagnosis's R10b-exclusion claim): apply Step 3's sub-steps 3a–3d ONLY (type alias, field, `None` init, setter — API surface with no fallback logic), re-run the same command, and observe `zero_turn_claude_transcript_on_disk_is_present_not_absent` and `fallback_present_feeds_ever_observed` FAIL with `left: Absent, right: Present` while the two guard tests pass. Record that output, then proceed to 3e–3f.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the fallback**

In `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs`:

3a. Add the type alias after the `KNOWN_PROVIDERS` const (imports `std::path::PathBuf` and `std::sync::Arc` are already at the top of the file):

```rust
/// Injected raw-file transcript check for claude (kata 09v1). Wiring installs
/// `freshell_freshagent::locate_transcript` — the SAME ordered-candidate-roots
/// scan the attach arm trusts (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` > `CLAUDE_HOME` >
/// `$HOME/.claude`) — so reconcile and attach can never disagree about whether
/// a claude transcript exists. A closure (not a direct call) keeps this probe
/// unit-testable without process-global env mutation; precedent:
/// `codex_rollout_locator` (main.rs).
pub type ClaudeTranscriptLocator = Arc<dyn Fn(&str) -> Option<PathBuf> + Send + Sync>;
```

3b. Add the field to the struct (after `provider_roots`):

```rust
    /// Zero-turn claude fallback (kata 09v1): a claude transcript can be on
    /// disk yet index-invisible — no cwd-bearing line (the e2e sidecar's
    /// create-time 0-byte file; crash-window partial writes) — so the index's
    /// R10b gate excludes it and the warm snapshot answers a false Absent
    /// while the attach arm would attempt resume on it.
    /// When set, a warm-index Absent for provider "claude" is re-checked
    /// against raw file existence before being finalized. `None` (tests,
    /// callers that never set it) keeps the pure index answer.
    claude_transcript_locator: Option<ClaudeTranscriptLocator>,
```

3c. Initialize it in `new()` (add one line to the `Self { ... }` literal; do NOT change `new`'s signature):

```rust
            claude_transcript_locator: None,
```

3d. Add the builder setter to the same `impl IndexExistenceProbe` block (after `new`):

```rust
    /// Builder-style: install the raw-file fallback for claude (see the field
    /// doc). Chained at the single production construction site in main.rs.
    pub fn with_claude_transcript_locator(mut self, locator: ClaudeTranscriptLocator) -> Self {
        self.claude_transcript_locator = Some(locator);
        self
    }
```

3e. Replace the `Some(items)` arm of the `match self.index.peek()` in `exists()` — currently:

```rust
            Some(items) => {
                self.record_observed(&items);
                let hit = items
                    .iter()
                    .any(|s| s.provider == provider && s.session_id == session_id);
                if hit {
                    SessionExistence::Present
                } else {
                    SessionExistence::Absent
                }
            }
```

with:

```rust
            Some(items) => {
                self.record_observed(&items);
                let hit = items
                    .iter()
                    .any(|s| s.provider == provider && s.session_id == session_id);
                if hit {
                    return SessionExistence::Present;
                }
                // Zero-turn claude fallback (kata 09v1): a claude transcript
                // can be on disk yet carry no cwd-bearing line (e2e fixture's
                // create-time 0-byte file; crash-window partial writes), so
                // the index's R10b gate
                // (directory_index.rs::parse_claude_file) excludes it and the
                // warm snapshot answers a false Absent, while the attach arm
                // (claude.rs::handle_attach via
                // claude_snapshot::locate_transcript) trusts raw file
                // existence and attempts resume. The two arms must agree: before
                // finalizing Absent for claude, consult the SAME raw-file
                // check. CLAUDE-scoped only — zero-turn codex genuinely has
                // no rollout file (reconcile_freshagent.rs module doc) — and
                // R10b itself stays intact for History listing.
                if provider == "claude" {
                    if let Some(locator) = &self.claude_transcript_locator {
                        if locator(session_id).is_some() {
                            // A fallback hit is an on-disk observation: feed
                            // the monotone observed-set (module-doc invariant)
                            // so a LATER genuine deletion still derives loud
                            // dead_session even without the ledger.
                            self.observed
                                .lock()
                                .expect("observed set lock")
                                .insert(format!("{provider}:{session_id}"));
                            return SessionExistence::Present;
                        }
                    }
                }
                SessionExistence::Absent
            }
```

3f. Extend the module doc (`//!` block at the top of the file): after the existing bullet ending "never a latched stale `Absent` (§9.1 test 13)", add:

```rust
//! * warm snapshot `Absent` for provider `claude` with a transcript locator
//!   installed → re-checked against raw file existence (kata 09v1): a claude
//!   transcript can be on disk yet cwd-less (e2e fixture's create-time 0-byte
//!   file; crash-window partial writes), so the R10b index gate excludes it —
//!   file present ⇒ `Present`, so reconcile agrees with the attach arm and
//!   never adjudicates dead a transcript the attach arm would try to resume.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-server existence
```
Expected: PASS — all 4 new tests AND all 7 pre-existing tests in the module (`ever_observed_survives_a_restart_via_the_ledger`, `unknown_provider_is_absent_never_unknown`, `cold_index_is_unknown_for_known_provider`, `missing_provider_root_is_provider_unavailable_not_unknown`, `existing_but_cold_provider_root_stays_unknown`, `session_written_after_cold_read_resolves_present_on_requery`, `ever_observed_survives_the_session_disappearing_from_disk`). The pre-existing tests all construct the probe WITHOUT a locator, proving default behavior is unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 5: Format, lint, workspace test**

Run:
```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```
Expected: all clean/PASS.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs
git commit -m "fix(reconcile): raw-file fallback for warm-index Absent on claude (kata 09v1)

A zero-turn claude transcript (0-byte, created at session create by the
e2e sidecar fixture; stands in for any on-disk-but-cwd-less shape) fails
the index's R10b cwd gate, so IndexExistenceProbe answered a false
Absent while the attach arm's raw-file check would attempt resume -- Absent +
ever_bound ledger row => GoneObserved => dead_session{session_not_on_disk}.
Add an injectable claude transcript locator consulted before finalizing
a warm-index Absent for provider claude. Claude-scoped (zero-turn codex
genuinely has no rollout file); R10b untouched; genuine deletion still
answers Absent (hazard guard tests)."
```

---

### Task 3: Visibility promotion + wiring — the acceptance e2e goes GREEN

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/claude_snapshot.rs` (one `pub(crate) fn` → `pub fn` + doc)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/lib.rs` (one `pub use` line)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` (chain the setter at the probe construction site, ~`:570`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `IndexExistenceProbe::with_claude_transcript_locator(self, locator: ClaudeTranscriptLocator) -> Self` (Task 2); `claude_snapshot::locate_transcript(session_id: &str) -> Option<PathBuf>` (existing, currently `pub(crate)`).
- Produces: `freshell_freshagent::locate_transcript(session_id: &str) -> Option<std::path::PathBuf>` — `pub` crate-root re-export (Task 6's gates and any future caller rely on this path).

- [ ] **Step 1: Promote `locate_transcript` to `pub` with an updated doc**

In `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/claude_snapshot.rs`, change the function (currently `pub(crate) fn locate_transcript`) to:

```rust
/// `find_transcript` across every candidate root, in resolution order.
/// Positive denial (attach) and snapshot 404 both require a miss EVERYWHERE.
/// `pub` + re-exported at the crate root (kata 09v1): `freshell-server`'s
/// `IndexExistenceProbe` consults this SAME check before finalizing a
/// warm-index `Absent` for claude — an on-disk transcript can be cwd-less
/// (fixture's create-time 0-byte file; crash-window partial writes) and so
/// fail the index's R10b cwd gate while the attach arm would still attempt
/// resume on it; the reconcile arm and the attach arm must share one
/// definition of "the transcript exists".
pub fn locate_transcript(session_id: &str) -> Option<PathBuf> {
    claude_home_candidates()
        .iter()
        .find_map(|root| find_transcript(root, session_id))
}
```

(Only the visibility keyword and doc change; the body is already exactly this. `find_transcript`, `claude_home_candidates`, `transcript_cwd`, `build_claude_snapshot_json`, `get_claude_snapshot` all stay `pub(crate)` — nothing else in this module should be visible outside the crate. `locate_transcript` already has a built-in path-traversal guard via `find_transcript`, so handing it a client-claimed session id is safe.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the narrow crate-root re-export**

In `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/lib.rs`, the module stays `pub(crate) mod claude_snapshot;`. In the `pub use` block (after `pub use claude::FreshClaudeState;`), add:

```rust
// Kata 09v1: the ONE claude_snapshot item visible outside this crate — the
// raw-file existence check freshell-server's IndexExistenceProbe shares with
// the attach arm. Keep the rest of claude_snapshot crate-private.
pub use claude_snapshot::locate_transcript;
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify it compiles**

Run:
```bash
cargo check -p freshell-freshagent -p freshell-server
```
Expected: clean (no E0364 — re-exporting a `pub fn` from a `pub(crate)` module is legal).

- [ ] **Step 4: Wire the locator at the single production construction site**

In `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs`, at the `session_existence` field of the `WsState` literal (~`:570`), the current shape is:

```rust
        session_existence: match &session_index {
            Some(index) => std::sync::Arc::new(existence::IndexExistenceProbe::new(
                std::sync::Arc::clone(index),
                Some(std::sync::Arc::clone(&pane_ledger)),
                session_directory::provider_home()
                    .map(|h| { /* ... provider_roots HashMap ... */ })
                    .unwrap_or_default(),
            )),
            None => std::sync::Arc::new(freshell_ws::existence::NoIndexProbe::default()),
        },
```

Chain the setter onto the `new(...)` call (keep every existing argument and its comments exactly as they are; only wrap):

```rust
            Some(index) => std::sync::Arc::new(
                existence::IndexExistenceProbe::new(
                    std::sync::Arc::clone(index),
                    // (existing ledger arg + comment unchanged)
                    Some(std::sync::Arc::clone(&pane_ledger)),
                    // (existing provider_roots arg + comments unchanged)
                    session_directory::provider_home()
                        .map(|h| { /* ... unchanged ... */ })
                        .unwrap_or_default(),
                )
                // Kata 09v1 zero-turn claude fallback: the SAME raw-file check
                // the attach arm trusts (claude_snapshot ordered candidate
                // roots, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR > CLAUDE_HOME > $HOME/.claude), so
                // reconcile and attach can never disagree about whether a
                // claude transcript exists. Degenerate no-roots case (HOME
                // unset etc.): locate_transcript answers None and the probe
                // keeps the pure index answer — identical to pre-fix behavior.
                .with_claude_transcript_locator(std::sync::Arc::new(
                    |session_id: &str| freshell_freshagent::locate_transcript(session_id),
                )),
            ),
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Full Rust gates + rebuild the release binary**

Run:
```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --release -p freshell-server
```
Expected: all clean/PASS; fresh `target/release/freshell-server` (the e2e harness does NOT rebuild a stale binary on its own).

- [ ] **Step 6: The kata's acceptance test goes GREEN — AS-IS, no turn added**

Run:
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --project=rust-chromium specs/hidden-pane-rebind-rust.spec.ts
```
Expected: **PASS — both tests** (the fresh-agent test that was RED in Task 1 Step 5, and the terminal test which must stay green). This is the kata's acceptance criterion.

**Known contingency (pre-analyzed during load-bearing validation — see the ledger):** the attach/rebind arm can emit a create with a PATH-shaped `resumeSessionId` (`…/<uuid>.jsonl`), and the fake sidecar crashes on it — uncaught ENOENT in `fake-claude-sidecar.mjs` `transcriptPath()` (~`:104` path-joins the path-shaped id), exiting before `created` (the REAL production sidecar instead reports a graceful `sdk.result error_during_execution`). Convergence via the reconcile-respawn UUID create is expected but has no green precedent. If this run stays RED with that signature in the sidecar request log (an `attach-resume-…` create carrying a path-shaped `resumeSessionId`, then sidecar exit), harden the fixture's `transcriptPath()` to accept path-shaped ids (use the basename's uuid, mirroring the real sidecar's tolerance) as a small, pre-approved additional change; record it in the task report and add the file to this task's commit.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-freshagent/src/claude_snapshot.rs crates/freshell-freshagent/src/lib.rs crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs
git commit -m "fix(server): wire the attach arm's locate_transcript into the existence probe

Promote claude_snapshot::locate_transcript to pub (narrow crate-root
re-export; the rest of the module stays crate-private) and inject it as
the probe's claude transcript locator at the single construction site.
hidden-pane-rebind-rust.spec.ts 'hidden fresh-agent pane recovers' goes
green AS-IS (zero-turn, no turn added) -- kata 09v1 acceptance."
```

### Task 4: Companion e2e — VISIBLE zero-turn freshclaude pane survives abrupt restart

Every other freshclaude-restart e2e sends a turn before restarting (satisfying R10b and masking this bug); the hidden-pane spec was the only zero-turn coverage, which is why the kata was mislabeled as hidden-pane-specific. This task closes the gap with a VISIBLE zero-turn spec. (Its red-proof against the pre-fix binary happens in Task 6 Step 3, after this spec exists and is registered.)

**Files:**
- Create: `test/e2e-browser/specs/freshclaude-zero-turn-restart-rust.spec.ts`
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts` (two registration points)
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/helpers/test-server.ts` (one-line `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` isolation guard, Step 2c)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `RustServer` (`restartAbrupt()`), `TestHarness`, `openPanePicker`, the fake claude sidecar fixture, and the per-spec helper convention (helpers are COPIED from a donor spec, never imported across specs — see the header of `restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts`).
- Produces: a registered rust-only spec that Task 6 runs by path.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the spec file**

Create `test/e2e-browser/specs/freshclaude-zero-turn-restart-rust.spec.ts`. Start from the donor `test/e2e-browser/specs/hidden-pane-rebind-rust.spec.ts`: copy VERBATIM its import block and `__dirname`/`FAKE_CLAUDE_SIDECAR_SOURCE` setup (donor lines 49–65) and these per-spec helpers, unchanged: `selectShellIfPickerShowing` (donor :52-62), `waitForWsReady` (:65-72), `seedWallConfig` (:75-97), `bootWall` (:100-114), `findFreshAgentLeaf` (:118-128), `createFreshclaudePane` (:153-182). Do NOT copy `restApiHeaders`/`createTabViaRest`/`revealTab` — this spec never hides the pane, and unused helpers fail lint. Then add this header comment and test body:

```ts
/**
 * FRESHCLAUDE ZERO-TURN RESTART (kata 09v1 regression) -- a VISIBLE
 * freshclaude pane with ZERO turns sent must survive an abrupt server
 * restart (RustServer.restartAbrupt(): SIGKILL + revive on the same
 * home/port/token) and resume in place -- never be adjudicated dead.
 *
 * Why this spec exists: the fake sidecar creates the transcript file AT
 * SESSION CREATE, before any turn -- a 0-byte .jsonl. (Validated: the REAL
 * CLI materializes the transcript only at first turn; the fixture's shape
 * stands in for any on-disk-but-R10b-excluded transcript, e.g. crash-window
 * partial writes.) That file fails the session index's R10b cwd gate, so pre-fix the
 * reconcile existence probe answered Absent while the attach arm's raw-file
 * check would happily resume it => DeadSession{session_not_on_disk} and the
 * 'Dead sessions' dialog. Every OTHER freshclaude-restart spec sends a turn
 * before restarting (which writes a cwd-bearing line and masks the bug);
 * hidden-pane-rebind-rust.spec.ts covers the HIDDEN zero-turn pane; this
 * spec covers the VISIBLE one. DO NOT add a turn before the restart --
 * zero-turn is the entire point.
 *
 * Rust-only: registered in RUST_ONLY_SPECS + rust-chromium testMatch,
 * because restartAbrupt() exists only on RustServer.
 *
 * Helpers are COPIED from hidden-pane-rebind-rust.spec.ts, not imported,
 * per this suite's per-spec-ownership convention.

```

Notes for the implementer: (a) if TypeScript complains about the `contentBefore`/`contentAfter` property accesses, mirror the donor spec's typing exactly — it performs the same accesses on the same `findFreshAgentLeaf(...)!.content!` value; (b) the `expect(..., message)` two-arg form — if the installed Playwright version rejects a message on a boolean `expect`, drop the message argument; (c) keep ESM `.js` extensions on the helper imports exactly as in the donor.

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the spec in BOTH config lists**

In `test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts`:

2a. Add to the `RUST_ONLY_SPECS` array (~`:81-155`), mirroring the existing hidden-pane entry's comment style:

```ts
  // Freshclaude zero-turn restart (kata 09v1): imports RustServer directly
  // for restartAbrupt(); a VISIBLE zero-turn pane must resume, never die.
  /freshclaude-zero-turn-restart-rust\.spec\.ts$/,
```

2b. Add to the `rust-chromium` project's `testMatch` array (~`:208-337`) an entry in the SAME format as the existing `hidden-pane-rebind-rust.spec.ts` entry there (copy that line, substitute the new filename).

2c. Neutralize `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in the e2e isolation helper (validated gap: `applyIsolatedHomeEnvironment` in `test/e2e-browser/helpers/test-server.ts` ~`:59-87` sets `HOME`/`CLAUDE_HOME`/`CODEX_HOME`/`XDG_DATA_HOME` and deletes `HOMEDRIVE`/`HOMEPATH`, but never clears `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — it is the HIGHEST-priority root for both the fake sidecar and, post-fix, the server's `locate_transcript` fallback, so an ambient value would break isolation and split the index root from the fallback root). In `applyIsolatedHomeEnvironment`, next to the existing `HOMEDRIVE`/`HOMEPATH` deletes, add:

```ts
  // Kata 09v1: CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR outranks CLAUDE_HOME for BOTH the sidecar
  // and the server's claude transcript-existence fallback; an ambient value
  // would escape the isolated home. Both server spawn paths route through
  // this helper, so deleting it here is the complete remedy.
  delete nextEnv.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
```

(Unset on the current machine — this is a determinism guard for other machines/CI, justified now because the fix makes reconcile verdicts newly depend on that root.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the new spec — GREEN on the fixed binary**

Run:
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --project=rust-chromium specs/freshclaude-zero-turn-restart-rust.spec.ts
```
Expected: PASS (Task 3's fixed release binary is current). Also verify project routing did not leak: `npm run test:e2e -- --list --project=chromium 2>/dev/null | grep -c zero-turn-restart` should print `0` (the match-all projects must ignore a rust-only spec).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add test/e2e-browser/specs/freshclaude-zero-turn-restart-rust.spec.ts test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts test/e2e-browser/helpers/test-server.ts
git commit -m "test(e2e): visible zero-turn freshclaude pane survives abrupt restart (kata 09v1)

Closes the coverage gap that mislabeled 09v1 as hidden-pane-specific:
every other freshclaude-restart spec sends a turn first (writing a
cwd-bearing transcript line and masking the R10b exclusion). This spec
keeps the pane visible, sends zero turns, SIGKILL-restarts, and asserts
in-place resume + no Dead-sessions dialog + stable createRequestId."
```

### Task 5: Module docs — record the claude asymmetry so nobody re-extends "acceptable either way"

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile_freshagent.rs` (module doc only, `:8-18`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the shipped fix (Tasks 2–3) — the doc describes real behavior, so it must land after the behavior.
- Produces: nothing programmatic; doc-only.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the claude bullet and update the WATCH bullet**

In the module doc of `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile_freshagent.rs`, after the existing zero-turn-codex bullet (the one ending "zero turns means there is no conversation content to lose."), insert:

```rust
//! - On-disk-but-index-invisible CLAUDE transcripts are the OPPOSITE
//!   asymmetry (kata 09v1): a claude transcript can exist on disk yet carry
//!   no cwd-bearing line (the e2e fixture creates a 0-byte file at session
//!   create; crash-window partial writes can leave the same shape), so the
//!   directory index's R10b gate excludes it and the warm index answers
//!   Absent — while the attach arm (freshell-freshagent claude_snapshot.rs)
//!   trusts raw file existence and would attempt resume on it. The
//!   IndexExistenceProbe (freshell-server existence.rs) therefore falls back
//!   to the attach arm's raw-file check (locate_transcript) before finalizing
//!   Absent for claude ⇒ Present ⇒ OnDisk ⇒ respawn, never dead_session.
//!   Do NOT re-extend the codex "acceptable either way" reasoning to claude:
//!   adjudicating dead a transcript the attach arm would try to resume is the
//!   two-arms-disagree bug this fix cures; if a resume genuinely cannot
//!   succeed (validated: the real CLI prompt-exits on unresumable ids), the
//!   pane converges to the honest, bounded dead_session{respawn_exhausted}
//!   via the respawn cap instead of a false session_not_on_disk.
```

And replace the final WATCH bullet — currently:

```rust
//! - WATCH: CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/CLAUDE_HOME reader/writer split (pre-existing
//!   wave-A exposure, out of scope this lane).
```

with:

```rust
//! - WATCH (narrowed by kata 09v1): CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/CLAUDE_HOME
//!   reader/writer split — the existence probe's claude Absent-fallback now
//!   reads the attach arm's FULL ordered candidate-root set
//!   (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR > CLAUDE_HOME > $HOME/.claude via
//!   locate_transcript), so RECONCILE verdicts no longer depend on the
//!   single-root index walk for file existence. The History index walk
//!   itself still reads one root; that residual listing exposure remains.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify the doc-only change builds and lints**

Run:
```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p freshell-ws
```
Expected: all clean/PASS (comment-only change; tests unaffected).

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile_freshagent.rs
git commit -m "docs(reconcile): record the claude zero-turn asymmetry next to the codex reasoning

The module doc explained zero-turn acceptability with codex-only
reasoning (no rollout file until first persisted turn -- 'acceptable
either way'). Claude is the opposite: a transcript can be on disk yet
cwd-less (fixture create-time file; crash-window partial writes), and
the attach arm would attempt resume on it, so dead_session there is the
two-arms-disagree false positive; failed respawns converge to the
honest respawn_exhausted via the cap. Also narrow the CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
WATCH: the existence probe's fallback now reads the attach arm's full
candidate-root set."
```

### Task 6: Full gates, wall, red-proof of the companion spec, push

**Files:**
- No source changes expected. Consumes `/tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server` (Task 1 Step 4).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above, committed.
- Produces: a pushed branch `fix/zero-turn-claude-existence` with all gates green. NO PR.

- [ ] **Step 1: Rust gates**

Run:
```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```
Expected: all clean/PASS.

- [ ] **Step 2: Coordinated node suites**

Run (`npm run test:status` first; if the coordinator gate is held by another agent, WAIT):
```bash
FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY="kata 09v1 zero-turn-claude-existence final gates" env -u FRESHELL_BIND_HOST npm test
npm run test:port
```
Expected: PASS on both.

- [ ] **Step 3: Red-proof the companion spec against the frozen pre-fix binary**

The companion spec must be shown to catch the bug it pins. Run it once against Task 1's saved pre-fix binary (the `FRESHELL_E2E_RUST_SERVER_BIN` override fails closed if the path is not an executable file). If `/tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server` is MISSING (tmp cleaners / reboots between tasks), rebuild it first from the recorded pre-fix base:

```bash
git worktree add /tmp/09v1-prefix-rebuild 53673c2c
(cd /tmp/09v1-prefix-rebuild && cargo build --release -p freshell-server)
cp /tmp/09v1-prefix-rebuild/target/release/freshell-server /tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server
chmod +x /tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server
git worktree remove --force /tmp/09v1-prefix-rebuild
```

```bash
FRESHELL_E2E_RUST_SERVER_BIN=/tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server \
  npm run test:e2e -- --project=rust-chromium specs/freshclaude-zero-turn-restart-rust.spec.ts
```
Expected: **FAIL** (pre-fix server adjudicates the zero-turn session dead — the resumed-poll times out and/or the Dead-sessions dialog assertion trips). Record the failure output in the task report. If it unexpectedly PASSES, the spec is not pinning the bug — STOP and fix the spec (compare against the hidden-pane spec's discriminators) before proceeding; first check the run's rust-server JSONL log for the second boot's `session_index_warm` vs `/ws 101` ordering to rule out a cold-index (`Unknown`⇒respawn) race misfire (validated as ~0.9s-margin unlikely, but it is the one known misfire shape).

Then confirm GREEN on the real (fixed) binary:
```bash
cargo build --release -p freshell-server
npm run test:e2e -- --project=rust-chromium specs/freshclaude-zero-turn-restart-rust.spec.ts
```
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: The three headline e2e specs on the fixed release build**

Run:
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --project=rust-chromium specs/hidden-pane-rebind-rust.spec.ts specs/freshclaude-zero-turn-restart-rust.spec.ts specs/freshclaude-restart-parity-rust.spec.ts
```
Expected: ALL PASS (hidden-pane: 2 tests; zero-turn: 1; parity: 2 — the parity specs send a turn first and exercise the index-hit path, proving the fallback didn't disturb the with-turn flow).

- [ ] **Step 5: The restore-contract-wall stays honest**

Run:
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --project=rust-chromium specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts
```
Expected: suite exits GREEN with **15 passing tests and 3 `test.fail()` pins reported as expected failures** (pins at ~`:1500` P0.1 composed ruler, ~`:1825` P1.8+P1.9 pane-created-<5s, ~`:1949` P1.8 locator-window). **No pin flip is expected from this fix.** Playwright turns an unexpected PASS of a pinned test into a hard failure — if that happens, do NOT delete the pin and do NOT celebrate: investigate WHY this change flipped it (re-run the leg 3x; read the pin's comment block for its flip discipline) and report findings before touching the pin.

- [ ] **Step 6: Push the branch and STOP (no PR)**

Run:
```bash
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
git push -u origin fix/zero-turn-claude-existence
```
Expected: the plan commit plus the four task commits (Tasks 2, 3, 4, 5); push succeeds. Do NOT run `gh pr create` or any equivalent — landing happens outside this workflow with the final review verdict.

- [ ] **Step 7: Cleanup**

```bash
rm -f /tmp/freshell-09v1-prefix-server
```
(Leave the read-only investigation artifacts — `/tmp/09v1-*`, `/tmp/freshell-e2e-rust-NaUAAO/`, `.worktrees/debug-09v1` — untouched; they are not this branch's to delete.)

## Spec-coverage map (self-review record)

| Spec requirement | Covering task |
|---|---|
| Two arms agree: warm-index `Absent` for claude falls back to the attach arm's raw-file check before finalizing (preferred fix shape) | Tasks 2–3 |
| R10b NOT weakened (History keeps real metadata) | Task 2 (fallback lives in the probe; `parse_claude_file` untouched — constraint restated in Global Constraints) |
| Codex untouched ("acceptable either way" stays correct FOR CODEX) | Task 2 (provider gate + `codex_absent_never_consults_the_claude_locator`) |
| kilroy covered | kilroy is a sessionType mapping to provider `"claude"` (verified: `claude.rs:66`, `snapshot.rs:133`) — the claude-scoped fallback covers it with no extra code |
| Alternative fix shapes evaluated in plan | Architecture section (two-probe-methods split rejected with reasons; injected-closure chosen over direct call for testability, with in-repo precedent) |
| Crate-dependency direction checked; injection-at-wiring if unclean | File Structure note (server→freshagent dep already exists; closure injection kept anyway for testability, precedent `codex_rollout_locator`) |
| Module doc claude-asymmetry bullet | Task 5 |
| Test (1) unit: zero-turn (0-byte + ever_bound) ⇒ respawn never dead_session; true positive stays | Task 2 (probe-level: `zero_turn_..._is_present_not_absent`, `fallback_present_feeds_ever_observed`, `genuinely_missing_..._stays_absent...`; the presence→verdict legs stay pinned by existing `on_disk_maps_to_respawn`, `gone_observed_maps_to_dead_session_not_on_disk`, `row4_absent_but_ever_observed_yields_dead_session`, `ever_observed_survives_a_restart_via_the_ledger` — all rerun in `cargo test --workspace`; end-to-end chain proven by the e2e specs) |
| Test (2) acceptance e2e AS-IS goes green | Task 1 (RED baseline) + Task 3 Step 6 (GREEN) |
| Test (3) NEW visible zero-turn companion e2e | Task 4 (+ Task 6 Step 3 red-proof against the frozen pre-fix binary) |
| Test (4) wall: 15 pass / 3 pins fail-as-expected; investigate any flip | Task 6 Step 5 |
| Repo rules: base green first, coordinator WAIT, ephemeral ports, no 3001/3002, no server restart, no broad kills, gates, push-no-PR | Task 1 Steps 1–3, Global Constraints, Task 6 |
| Load-bearing validation (2026-07-28): A1/A2 falsified (real CLI materializes transcript at first turn; 0-byte not resumable) — all rationale/doc/commit text corrected; terminal-arm + respawn-cap behavior changes called out; perf measured; fixture path-resume-crash contingency; /tmp binary rebuild fallback; CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR guard | Validated-reality / Consumer-failure-mode / Perf notes (File Structure section); Tasks 2, 3 Step 6, 4 Step 2c, 5, 6 Step 3; full ledger at `.worktrees/.the-usual-logs/zero-turn-claude-existence/load-bearing-ledger.md` |
| No stubs/mocks standing in for required behavior | The fake claude sidecar is the suite's ESTABLISHED provider seam (used by the acceptance spec and the wall itself); it reproduces the real CLI's create-time transcript behavior, which is the load-bearing precondition. The Rust-side fake locator closures test the probe's own logic; the REAL `locate_transcript` wiring is exercised end-to-end by Tasks 3/4/6 e2e against the release binary. No requirement is deferred. |
