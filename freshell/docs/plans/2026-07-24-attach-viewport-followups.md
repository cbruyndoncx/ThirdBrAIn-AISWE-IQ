# Attach-Viewport Follow-Ups Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** This plan is executed task-by-task by the
> workflow's execute stage: a fresh implementer per task, with a spec +
> quality review after each task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax
> for tracking.

**Goal:** Complete the three deferred follow-ups from the TERM-07 attach-viewport work: clear the pre-existing `freshell-platform` clippy baseline, port Node's exact dimension floor/range semantics to the Rust resize/attach/spawn paths, and extract the duplicated `freshell-ws` integration-test harness into a shared `tests/common/` module.

**Architecture:** Three workstreams (independent in code, but Task 1 must land FIRST: `-D warnings` denies warnings in workspace path-deps too, so no later task's clippy gate passes until the workspace clippy baseline is clean — see Global Constraints) on top of the unmerged `fix/rust-attach-viewport` branch code (already present in this worktree's history). Follow-up 2 ports Node's dimension handling at the three layers where Node actually implements it: reject-out-of-range at the WS protocol boundary (Zod parity), floor-at-2 in geometry bookkeeping (broker parity), and falsy-coalesce defaults at spawn (`opts.cols || 120` parity). Follow-up 3 establishes the standard Cargo `tests/common/mod.rs` convention (the workspace has no existing test-sharing convention — this creates it).

**Tech Stack:** Rust (cargo, clippy, rustfmt), tokio + axum + tokio-tungstenite 0.24 integration tests, serde/serde_json wire protocol.

## Global Constraints

- **Base branch:** this worktree (`/home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/attach-viewport-followups`, branch `fix/attach-viewport-followups`) is forked from `fix/rust-attach-viewport` (HEAD `55f58545`). NEVER rebase onto or fork from `origin/main` — the code these follow-ups modify exists only on this branch lineage.
- **Rust-only:** never modify `server/` (Node), `shared/`, or `src/` (client). All changes live under `crates/`.
- **Node parity values (copied verbatim from Node source):**
  - Protocol bounds (`shared/ws-protocol.ts:344-345, 364-365`): `cols: z.number().int().min(2).max(1000)`, `rows: z.number().int().min(2).max(500)` — enforcement is **reject** with `INVALID_MESSAGE` (`server/ws-handler.ts:1856-1858`), not clamp.
  - Geometry bookkeeping floor (`server/terminal-stream/broker.ts:672-673`): `Math.max(2, Math.floor(Number.isFinite(cols) ? cols : 80))` / `Math.max(2, Math.floor(Number.isFinite(rows) ? rows : 24))`.
  - Spawn defaults (`server/terminal-registry.ts:1572-1573`): `const cols = opts.cols || 120`, `const rows = opts.rows || 30` — falsy-coalesce (0 → default), NOT a floor (1 passes through).
- **Known baseline test failures (gate = no NEW failures, these 2 stay failing; re-verified live on this HEAD, 2026-07-24):**
  1. `freshell-ws` test `codex_session_ref_resume` — `PTY_SPAWN_FAILED: Unable to resolve MCP dependency "tsx"` (worktree lacks `node_modules/`; do not chase in Rust code).
  2. `freshell-ws` test `session_identity_frames::fresh_claude_create_frames_carry_preallocated_session_ref` — deterministic (verified 4/4 runs: same test, same panic site `session_identity_frames.rs:197`, ~5s fast internal wait-timeout, not a long hang), pre-existing on the base branch.
  - IMPORTANT: plain `cargo test -p freshell-ws` FAIL-FASTS at the first failing test binary (`codex_session_ref_resume`) and never runs `session_identity_frames` or later binaries. Full-suite baseline comparisons MUST use `cargo test -p freshell-ws --no-fail-fast`.
- **Clippy gate scope (verified live, clippy 0.1.96):** `-- -D warnings` applies to EVERY workspace crate compiled in the invocation, including non-selected path-deps (cargo-clippy wraps all workspace members via `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER`). Consequences: no clippy gate in this plan passes until `freshell-platform`'s lib is clean, and the `-p freshell-ws` gate additionally requires `freshell-freshagent`'s lib clean. Hence Task 1 clears the full 14-diagnostic workspace baseline and must complete before any other task's clippy step.
- **Standard verification commands** (from `docs/plans/2026-07-24-rust-attach-viewport.md:870-875`; there is no justfile/Makefile/CI for Rust):
  - `cargo test -p freshell-platform`, `cargo test -p freshell-terminal`, `cargo test -p freshell-ws --no-fail-fast`
  - `cargo fmt --all --check`
  - `cargo clippy -p freshell-platform -p freshell-terminal -p freshell-ws --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- **Lint policy:** fix the code, never `#[allow]` — with ONE justified exception: `#![allow(dead_code)]` at the top of `tests/common/mod.rs` is the idiomatic Rust pattern for shared integration-test modules (each test binary compiles the whole module; unused helpers per-binary are expected by design).
- **Repo rules:** Red-Green-Refactor TDD for behavior changes; never restart the self-hosted Freshell server; no `gh pr create` without explicit user approval; ≤1K lines/file where feasible (`spawn.rs` is already at 1071 lines — do not grow it; new tests go in a `#[path]`-included sibling file, the repo's established convention, see `cli_launch.rs:540`, `mcp_inject.rs:672`).
- **Commit convention:** Conventional Commits with `(rust)` scope, e.g. `fix(rust): ...`, `refactor(rust): ...`.
- **JS/Vitest suite:** NOT required — Rust-only diff ("Rust checks are NOT gated by the JS coordinator").

**Explicitly out of scope (recorded, not silently dropped — none are spec requirements):**
- Migrating the other 11 `freshell-ws` test files to `tests/common/` (`term09_output_queue.rs` uses a different socket type `WebSocketStream<TcpStream>` via socket2 and needs generic helpers; the rest are cheap follow-ups once the module exists). The spec requires migrating the attach-viewport tests + the donor file only.
- Node's `status !== 'running'` guard missing from Rust `TerminalRegistry::resize` (`terminal-registry.ts:4027` vs `registry.rs:1004`) — a real parity gap discovered during investigation, but it is not floor semantics and is not in the spec's scope. Recorded here for a future follow-up.
- Malformed-frame parity: Rust silently drops frames that fail serde parsing (non-integer `cols`, wrong types, malformed JSON — the deliberate accept-and-strip design at `terminal.rs:418-419, :438-440`), where Node replies `INVALID_MESSAGE` (`ws-handler.ts:1807, :1856-1858`). Task 5's scope is dimension RANGE parity for well-formed integer frames only (the only reading the recorded spec text supports); changing the cross-cutting parse-failure behavior for all message types is out of scope. Recorded for a future follow-up.
- The 28 additional `clippy::await_holding_lock` warnings in `freshell-freshagent`'s `#[cfg(test)]` lib-test code (claude.rs:1004+, codex.rs:3754+) — no plan gate selects `-p freshell-freshagent --all-targets`, and dep builds compile only its lib, so these do not gate this plan. They WOULD block a future `--workspace` clippy gate.

### Task 1: Clear the workspace clippy baseline (all 14 diagnostics gating this plan)

The baseline has **14 clippy diagnostics across three crates** that gate this plan's `-D warnings` invocations (verified live on this HEAD with fresh target dirs — see `.worktrees/.the-usual-logs/attach-viewport-followups/reports/validator-A6b.md`): 7 in `freshell-platform` (6 lib — the "6 pre-existing lint errors" recorded by the prior work — plus 1 in the lib-test target that `--all-targets` surfaces), 3 in `freshell-freshagent`'s lib, 1 in `freshell-ws`'s lib, and 3 in a `freshell-ws` test binary. The non-platform ones were previously masked because platform's denied warnings aborted clippy before downstream diagnostics emitted — and because `-D warnings` denies warnings in workspace path-deps too (see Global Constraints), ALL 14 must be cleared for the per-crate gates in Tasks 2/3/4/5 and the combined gate in Task 6 to pass. The platform 7 have mechanical clippy-suggested fixes; the other 7 are small, behavior-preserving refactors. No behavior change — the existing test suite is the regression net.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-platform/src/cli_launch.rs:318`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-platform/src/spawn.rs:288,509-511`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-platform/src/network.rs:415`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-platform/src/mcp_inject_tests.rs:3`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/claude.rs:8-9`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/terminal_tabs.rs:550`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs:1906` (large_enum_variant)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/freshagent_claude_kill_interrupt.rs:312,368,419`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from other tasks.
- Produces: the clippy-clean workspace baseline that EVERY later task's clippy gate depends on (Tasks 2/3/4/5 per-crate gates and Task 6's combined gate all fail until this task lands — dep-denial, see Global Constraints). This task must complete first.

- [ ] **Step 1: Reproduce the baseline failures (RED)**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/attach-viewport-followups
cargo clippy -p freshell-platform --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
Expected: FAIL (exit 101) with exactly these 7 errors:
- `cli_launch.rs:318` — `manual_pattern_char_comparison`
- `spawn.rs:288` — `nonminimal_bool`
- `spawn.rs:509`, `spawn.rs:510`, `spawn.rs:511` — `doc_lazy_continuation` (×3)
- `network.rs:415` — `trim_split_whitespace`
- `mcp_inject_tests.rs:3` — `doc_lazy_continuation` (lib-test target)

Also reproduce the ws-gate failures (they are part of this task's RED):
```bash
cargo clippy -p freshell-ws --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
Expected: FAIL — after the platform-lib errors, this gate additionally denies: `freshell-freshagent` lib `claude.rs:8`, `claude.rs:9` (`doc_lazy_continuation` ×2) and `terminal_tabs.rs:550` (`manual_map`); `freshell-ws` lib `terminal.rs:1906` (`large_enum_variant`); `freshell-ws` test `freshagent_claude_kill_interrupt.rs:312/:368/:419` (`await_holding_lock` ×3). (Some may only surface once earlier errors are fixed — clippy aborts a crate's build on its first denied crate; the diagnostic-by-gate table is in `validator-A6b.md`.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Fix `cli_launch.rs:318` (manual_pattern_char_comparison)**

Change line 318 from:
```rust
            .find(|c| matches!(c, '/' | ':' | '?' | '#'))
```
to:
```rust
            .find(['/', ':', '?', '#'])
```
(`str::find` accepts a `[char; N]` pattern directly — this is clippy's own suggestion.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Fix `spawn.rs:288` (nonminimal_bool)**

Change line 288 from:
```rust
    if !(crate::detect::is_windows_like(host_os, is_wsl_env) && !in_wsl_with_linux_shell) {
```
to:
```rust
    if !crate::detect::is_windows_like(host_os, is_wsl_env) || in_wsl_with_linux_shell {
```
(De Morgan equivalence — `!(A && !B) == !A || B`. Semantics identical.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Fix `spawn.rs:509-511` (doc_lazy_continuation ×3)**

These three `///` lines are continuations of a doc list item and need two-space indentation (clippy's suggested fix). Change:
```rust
/// same `resolveUnixShellCwd`, so a claude/codex/opencode terminal lands in the
/// requested directory with `CLAUDECODE` stripped (which the reference notes is
/// required or child Claude refuses to start).
```
to:
```rust
///   same `resolveUnixShellCwd`, so a claude/codex/opencode terminal lands in the
///   requested directory with `CLAUDECODE` stripped (which the reference notes is
///   required or child Claude refuses to start).
```
(Look at the preceding line ~508 first: if these lines are actually meant as a standalone paragraph rather than a list-item continuation, the alternative fix is inserting a bare `///` blank line before line 509 — either resolves the lint; pick whichever preserves the rendered meaning.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Fix `network.rs:415` (trim_split_whitespace)**

Change line 415 from:
```rust
        let mut parts = line.trim().split_whitespace();
```
to:
```rust
        let mut parts = line.split_whitespace();
```
(`split_whitespace` already ignores leading/trailing whitespace — identical semantics.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Fix `mcp_inject_tests.rs:3` (doc_lazy_continuation)**

Change line 3 from:
```rust
//! Split out to respect the campaign's ≤1K-lines-per-file limit.
```
to:
```rust
//!   Split out to respect the campaign's ≤1K-lines-per-file limit.
```
(Same lint as Step 4; same alternative applies — a bare `//!` blank line above line 3 if it reads as its own paragraph.)

- [ ] **Step 7: Verify the platform gate is clean (GREEN for platform)**

Run:
```bash
cargo clippy -p freshell-platform --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
Expected: PASS (exit 0, zero warnings).

- [ ] **Step 8: Fix `freshell-freshagent` `claude.rs:8-9` (doc_lazy_continuation ×2)**

Same lint and same mechanical fix as Steps 4/6: these are doc-comment continuation lines — either indent the continuation lines by two spaces or insert a bare doc-comment blank line above them, whichever preserves the rendered meaning (inspect the surrounding doc block first).

- [ ] **Step 9: Fix `freshell-freshagent` `terminal_tabs.rs:550` (manual_map)**

Apply clippy's suggested fix: replace the manual `match`-over-`Option` that returns `Some(...)`/`None` with the equivalent `.map(...)` call. Behavior-identical by construction; do not otherwise restructure the function.

- [ ] **Step 10: Fix `freshell-ws` `terminal.rs:1906` (large_enum_variant)**

Apply clippy's suggested fix (typically `Box`ing the oversized variant's payload). This touches the variant's construction and match sites — make the minimal set of edits clippy's suggestion implies, nothing more. NOTE: this fix shifts line numbers in `terminal.rs`; Task 5's cited line numbers were taken BEFORE this fix — Task 5's implementer must locate edit sites by symbol/signature, not raw line number. Verify behavior with:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws --lib
```
Expected: 147 passed (the verified baseline).

- [ ] **Step 11: Fix `freshell-ws` `tests/freshagent_claude_kill_interrupt.rs:312,368,419` (await_holding_lock ×3)**

At each site a std `MutexGuard` is held across `.await` points. Do NOT narrow the guard's scope or drop it early: `CLAUDE_ENV_LOCK` exists to serialize ENTIRE tests that mutate the process-global `FRESHELL_CLAUDE_SIDECAR`/`FRESHELL_CLAUDE_NODE` env vars (its doc comment at :47-49), and `FakeClaudeSidecarEnv`'s contract (:94-97) requires the lock be held for the lifetime of the returned guard — releasing it before `spawn_server().await` would let the three tests (run concurrently by cargo's parallel test runner) race each other's env vars and interrupt-log files. Instead, migrate the lock to `tokio::sync::Mutex`, whose guard is designed to be held across `.await` and is not flagged by `clippy::await_holding_lock`. Mutual-exclusion semantics are preserved exactly:

1. Change the declaration at :50 from `static CLAUDE_ENV_LOCK: Mutex<()> = Mutex::new(());` to `static CLAUDE_ENV_LOCK: tokio::sync::Mutex<()> = tokio::sync::Mutex::const_new(());`. (The crate's tokio dependency already enables the `sync` feature — `Cargo.toml:54` — so no manifest change. If the resolved tokio version lacks `const_new`, fall back to `static CLAUDE_ENV_LOCK: std::sync::LazyLock<tokio::sync::Mutex<()>> = std::sync::LazyLock::new(|| tokio::sync::Mutex::new(()));` and lock via `CLAUDE_ENV_LOCK.lock().await` identically.)
2. Change all three acquisitions (:312, :368, :419) from `let _guard = CLAUDE_ENV_LOCK.lock().unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner());` to `let _guard = CLAUDE_ENV_LOCK.lock().await;` — tokio's mutex has no poisoning, so the `unwrap_or_else` disappears. All three holders are `#[tokio::test]` async fns, so `.await` is available; the plain `#[test]` at :450 never acquires the lock and needs no change.
3. Keep each guard bound for the full test body — unchanged from today.
4. If `Mutex` in the `use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};` import at :35 becomes unused, remove just `Mutex` from that import (keep `Arc`); the compiler/clippy will confirm.

Verify with:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws --test freshagent_claude_kill_interrupt
```
Expected: 4 passed (the verified baseline).

- [ ] **Step 12: Verify ALL of this plan's clippy gates are clean (GREEN)**

Run:
```bash
cargo clippy -p freshell-platform --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p freshell-terminal --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p freshell-ws --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p freshell-platform -p freshell-terminal -p freshell-ws --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
Expected: all four exit 0, zero warnings. (Do NOT add a `-p freshell-freshagent --all-targets` gate: its lib-test target has 28 additional pre-existing `await_holding_lock` warnings that no plan gate compiles — recorded out of scope in Global Constraints.)

- [ ] **Step 13: Verify no behavior change**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-platform
cargo test -p freshell-ws --lib
cargo test -p freshell-ws --test freshagent_claude_kill_interrupt
cargo fmt --all
cargo fmt --all --check
```
Expected: all tests PASS (platform suite, ws lib 147, kill_interrupt 4 — all green on the verified baseline); fmt check PASS.

- [ ] **Step 14: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-platform/src/cli_launch.rs crates/freshell-platform/src/spawn.rs crates/freshell-platform/src/network.rs crates/freshell-platform/src/mcp_inject_tests.rs crates/freshell-freshagent/src/claude.rs crates/freshell-freshagent/src/terminal_tabs.rs crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs crates/freshell-ws/tests/freshagent_claude_kill_interrupt.rs
git commit -m "fix(rust): clear workspace clippy baseline (14 pre-existing warnings gating -D warnings)"
```

### Task 2: Extract shared freshell-ws integration-test harness (`tests/common/`)

`crates/freshell-ws/tests/attach_viewport_resize.rs` (AVR, the new TERM-07 tests) and `crates/freshell-ws/tests/session_identity_frames.rs` (SIF, the donor) contain **175 byte-for-byte identical lines** of harness code (verified: `AVR:8-182` == `SIF:17-191`; a `diff` of the two ranges shows only the module-doc hunk and the divergence point). No sharing convention exists anywhere in the workspace — this task establishes the standard Cargo idiom: `tests/common/mod.rs` (subdirectories of `tests/` are NOT compiled as test binaries, so this needs no `Cargo.toml` change).

**Pure refactor: zero behavior change.** Helper bodies move verbatim; the receipt is that both test binaries produce identical results before and after (including SIF's one known-failing test).

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/common/mod.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/attach_viewport_resize.rs` (delete lines 8–323, add `mod common;`)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/tests/session_identity_frames.rs` (delete lines 17–217, add `mod common;`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1's clippy-clean workspace baseline (Step 7's `-p freshell-ws` gate fails on freshagent/platform dep warnings without it).
- Produces (Task 5 relies on these, re-exported from `common`): `pub const AUTH_TOKEN: &str`, `pub fn test_settings_value() -> serde_json::Value`, `pub fn sleeper_cli_spec(name: &str) -> freshell_platform::CliCommandSpec`, `pub async fn spawn_server() -> (String, freshell_terminal::TerminalRegistry)`, `pub type TestWs = tokio_tungstenite::WebSocketStream<tokio_tungstenite::MaybeTlsStream<tokio::net::TcpStream>>`, `pub async fn connect_and_capture_inventory(url: &str) -> (TestWs, serde_json::Value)`, `pub async fn create_shell_terminal(ws: &mut TestWs, request_id: &str) -> String`, `pub async fn drain_until_marker_or_deadline(ws: &mut TestWs, marker: &str, deadline: tokio::time::Instant) -> (String, bool, bool)`, `pub async fn attach_with(ws: &mut TestWs, terminal_id: &str, attach_request_id: &str, intent: &str, cols: u16, rows: u16, expected_session_ref: Option<serde_json::Value>)`, `pub async fn wait_for_attach_ready(ws: &mut TestWs, attach_request_id: &str)`, `pub async fn send_input(ws: &mut TestWs, terminal_id: &str, data: &str)`, `pub async fn next_frame_of_type(ws: &mut TestWs, wanted: &str) -> serde_json::Value`, `pub fn session_ref_of(frame: &serde_json::Value) -> Option<serde_json::Value>`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Record the baseline (GREEN before)**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/attach-viewport-followups
cargo test -p freshell-ws --test attach_viewport_resize --test session_identity_frames 2>&1 | tail -30
```
Expected: `attach_viewport_resize` — 3 passed. `session_identity_frames` — 2 passed, 1 failed (`fresh_claude_create_frames_carry_preallocated_session_ref`, the known baseline timeout — see Global Constraints). Save this output; Step 6 must match it exactly.

- [ ] **Step 2: Create `crates/freshell-ws/tests/common/mod.rs`**

File header (write this verbatim), followed by the moved items:

```rust
//! Shared integration-test harness for `freshell-ws` WS tests.
//!
//! Extracted verbatim from `attach_viewport_resize.rs` and
//! `session_identity_frames.rs`, whose harness sections were byte-identical
//! copies. Compiled into each test binary that declares `mod common;` —
//! helpers unused by a given binary are expected, hence the file-level
//! `dead_code` allow (the idiomatic pattern for `tests/common/mod.rs`).
#![allow(dead_code)]
```

Then MOVE the following items, byte-for-byte (do not edit bodies), from the source files, adding `pub` to each item declaration (`pub const`, `pub fn`, `pub async fn`, `pub type`):

| Item | Move from (exact lines) |
|---|---|
| `use` block | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:9-16` |
| `const AUTH_TOKEN` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:18` |
| `fn test_settings_value()` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:20-38` |
| `fn sleeper_cli_spec(name: &str)` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:40-76` |
| `async fn spawn_server()` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:78-139` |
| `type TestWs` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:141-142` |
| `async fn connect_and_capture_inventory(url)` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:144-181` |
| `async fn create_shell_terminal(ws, request_id)` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:183-218` |
| `async fn drain_until_marker_or_deadline(ws, marker, deadline)` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:220-263` |
| `async fn attach_with(ws, id, rid, intent, cols, rows, expected_session_ref)` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:265-288` |
| `async fn wait_for_attach_ready(ws, rid)` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:290-310` |
| `async fn send_input(ws, id, data)` | `attach_viewport_resize.rs:312-323` |
| `async fn next_frame_of_type(ws, wanted)` | `session_identity_frames.rs:192-208` |
| `fn session_ref_of(frame)` | `session_identity_frames.rs:210-217` |

Keep doc comments attached to their items. Do NOT rename anything, change temp-file prefixes, tighten bounds, or add builders — verbatim move only (zero behavior change is the acceptance gate; the report-noted `sleeper_cli_spec` temp-path scheme is pre-existing behavior and stays as-is).

- [ ] **Step 3: Migrate `attach_viewport_resize.rs`**

Keep lines 1–7 (the module doc) unchanged. Replace everything from line 8 through line 323 (the blank line + all helpers, up to but NOT including the first `#[tokio::test]` at line 325) with:

```rust
mod common;
use common::*;
```

Then keep the original `use` block imports that the TEST BODIES themselves still need (the three tests at lines 325+ may call `SinkExt`/`StreamExt` methods, `serde_json::json!`, `Duration`, `WsMessage`, etc. directly). Procedure: after the edit, run
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws --test attach_viewport_resize --no-run
```
and (a) re-add any import the compiler reports as missing, (b) remove any import it warns is unused. End state: compiles with zero warnings.

- [ ] **Step 4: Migrate `session_identity_frames.rs`**

Keep lines 1–16 (the module doc) unchanged. Replace lines 17 through 217 (all helpers, up to but NOT including the first `#[tokio::test]` at line 219) with:

```rust
mod common;
use common::*;
```

Same import-fixup procedure:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws --test session_identity_frames --no-run
```
End state: compiles with zero warnings.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify the whole crate's test targets still compile**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws --no-run
```
Expected: PASS. (Other test files are untouched — `tests/common/` is additive; files without `mod common;` are unaffected.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the migrated tests (GREEN after — must match Step 1 exactly)**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws --test attach_viewport_resize --test session_identity_frames 2>&1 | tail -30
```
Expected: identical results to Step 1 — AVR 3 passed; SIF 2 passed, 1 failed (the same known-baseline test, `fresh_claude_create_frames_carry_preallocated_session_ref`). Any OTHER failure means the refactor changed behavior: stop and fix before proceeding.

- [ ] **Step 7: Lint and format**

Run:
```bash
cargo clippy -p freshell-ws --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
cargo fmt --all --check
```
Expected: clippy PASS (the `#![allow(dead_code)]` header covers per-binary unused helpers); fmt clean.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/tests/common/mod.rs crates/freshell-ws/tests/attach_viewport_resize.rs crates/freshell-ws/tests/session_identity_frames.rs
git commit -m "refactor(rust): extract shared freshell-ws integration-test harness into tests/common"
```

### Task 3: Spawn geometry falsy-coalesce parity (`opts.cols || 120`)

Node's spawn path (`terminal-registry.ts:1572-1573`) uses `opts.cols || 120` / `opts.rows || 30` — JavaScript falsy-coalesce, so `0` falls back to the default while every non-zero value (including `1`) passes through unclamped. Rust's three spawn-spec builders use `cols.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_COLS)`, so `Some(0)` produces a 0-column PTY where Node self-heals to 120. Port the exact falsy semantics via one shared helper. (This is the only spawn-path divergence; there is deliberately NO floor-of-2 at spawn — Node has none.)

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-platform/src/spawn.rs` (helper near `DEFAULT_COLS` at :102-103; call sites at :368-369, :538-539, :582-583; `#[path]` test-mod hook at end of file)
- Test: `crates/freshell-platform/src/spawn_dims_tests.rs` (new, `#[path]`-included — keeps `spawn.rs` from growing past its already-over-limit 1071 lines, following the repo's `cli_launch.rs:540` / `mcp_inject.rs:672` convention)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `pub const DEFAULT_COLS: u16 = 120;` / `pub const DEFAULT_ROWS: u16 = 30;` (existing, `spawn.rs:102-103`).
- Produces: `pub fn dim_or_default(dim: Option<u16>, default: u16) -> u16` in `freshell_platform::spawn` (used only within `spawn.rs`'s three builders; no other task consumes it).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `crates/freshell-platform/src/spawn_dims_tests.rs`:

```rust
//! Node-parity tests for spawn geometry defaulting.
//!
//! Reference: `terminal-registry.ts:1572-1573` — `const cols = opts.cols || 120`,
//! `const rows = opts.rows || 30`. `||` is a falsy-coalesce, not a clamp: `0`
//! (the only falsy `u16`) falls back to the default; every non-zero value —
//! including values below the resize floor — passes through unchanged.

use super::{dim_or_default, DEFAULT_COLS, DEFAULT_ROWS};

#[test]
fn none_falls_back_to_default() {
    assert_eq!(dim_or_default(None, DEFAULT_COLS), 120);
    assert_eq!(dim_or_default(None, DEFAULT_ROWS), 30);
}

#[test]
fn zero_is_falsy_and_falls_back_to_default() {
    // Node: `0 || 120` → 120. The old Rust `unwrap_or` produced 0 here.
    assert_eq!(dim_or_default(Some(0), DEFAULT_COLS), 120);
    assert_eq!(dim_or_default(Some(0), DEFAULT_ROWS), 30);
}

#[test]
fn one_passes_through_because_spawn_has_no_floor() {
    // Node: `1 || 120` → 1 (truthy). Spawn is falsy-coalesce only, never a clamp.
    assert_eq!(dim_or_default(Some(1), DEFAULT_COLS), 1);
    assert_eq!(dim_or_default(Some(1), DEFAULT_ROWS), 1);
}

#[test]
fn normal_values_pass_through() {
    assert_eq!(dim_or_default(Some(95), DEFAULT_COLS), 95);
    assert_eq!(dim_or_default(Some(41), DEFAULT_ROWS), 41);
}
```

Then hook the module in at the very end of `crates/freshell-platform/src/spawn.rs`:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
#[path = "spawn_dims_tests.rs"]
mod spawn_dims_tests;
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail (RED)**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-platform spawn_dims_tests
```
Expected: FAIL to compile — `cannot find function `dim_or_default``.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the helper and wire the three builders (GREEN)**

In `crates/freshell-platform/src/spawn.rs`, directly below the `DEFAULT_COLS`/`DEFAULT_ROWS` constants (:102-103), add:

```rust
/// Node-parity spawn geometry defaulting (`terminal-registry.ts:1572-1573`:
/// `opts.cols || 120`, `opts.rows || 30`). JavaScript `||` is a
/// falsy-coalesce, not a clamp: `0` (the only falsy `u16`) falls back to the
/// default, and every non-zero value passes through unchanged — there is no
/// minimum floor on the spawn path in Node, so there is none here.
pub fn dim_or_default(dim: Option<u16>, default: u16) -> u16 {
    match dim {
        None | Some(0) => default,
        Some(v) => v,
    }
}
```

Then replace all three `unwrap_or` call-site pairs:

In `build_spawn_spec` (:368-369), change:
```rust
    let cols = cols.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_COLS);
    let rows = rows.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_ROWS);
```
to:
```rust
    let cols = dim_or_default(cols, DEFAULT_COLS);
    let rows = dim_or_default(rows, DEFAULT_ROWS);
```

In `build_cli_spawn_spec` (:538-539), change:
```rust
        cols: cols.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_COLS),
        rows: rows.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_ROWS),
```
to:
```rust
        cols: dim_or_default(cols, DEFAULT_COLS),
        rows: dim_or_default(rows, DEFAULT_ROWS),
```

In `build_windows_cli_spawn_spec` (:582-583), change:
```rust
    let cols = cols.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_COLS);
    let rows = rows.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_ROWS);
```
to:
```rust
    let cols = dim_or_default(cols, DEFAULT_COLS);
    let rows = dim_or_default(rows, DEFAULT_ROWS);
```

(Verify with `grep -n "unwrap_or(DEFAULT" crates/freshell-platform/src/spawn.rs` that zero call sites remain.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-platform
```
Expected: PASS — the 4 new tests plus the entire existing suite (all live callers pass `None`, so observable spawn behavior is unchanged at 120×30).

- [ ] **Step 5: Lint, format, commit**

Run:
```bash
cargo clippy -p freshell-platform --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
git add crates/freshell-platform/src/spawn.rs crates/freshell-platform/src/spawn_dims_tests.rs
git commit -m "fix(rust): port Node falsy-coalesce spawn geometry defaults (opts.cols || 120)"
```
Expected: clippy exit 0 (keeps Task 1's win), commit succeeds.

### Task 4: Registry geometry floor at 2 (broker bookkeeping parity)

Node's only explicit dimension clamp is in the broker's geometry bookkeeping (`broker.ts:672-673`): `Math.max(2, Math.floor(Number.isFinite(cols) ? cols : 80))` (rows: fallback 24). In Rust, geometry bookkeeping and the PTY resize are unified in `TerminalRegistry::resize` / `resize_for_attach` (`s.cols`/`s.rows` back both `geometry()` and `pty.resize`), and today they store and forward raw values — `0` included. Port the formula at that layer: for `u16` input (always finite, always integral), `Math.max(2, Math.floor(finite ? x : fallback))` reduces exactly to `.max(2)` — the `floor` and non-finite fallback arms are unrepresentable. This is Node's formula applied at the equivalent Rust layer, not an invented clamp.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-terminal/src/registry.rs` (`resize` at :1004-1024, `resize_for_attach` at :1038-1087, new const nearby)
- Test: `crates/freshell-terminal/src/registry.rs` in-file `mod tests` (the crate's established convention — 13 existing resize/geometry tests live there, e.g. `resize_updates_geometry_epoch_only_on_change` at :2657)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: existing `TerminalRegistry::geometry(&self, terminal_id: &str) -> Option<(u16, u16, i64)>` (:1092), `reg.insert_headless("T", "S")` test seeding (seeds 120×30, epoch 1), `AttachResizeStatus` enum, `TerminalAttachIntent` enum — all already on this branch. Also Task 1's clippy-clean workspace baseline (Step 5's `-p freshell-terminal` gate fails on platform-as-dep warnings without it, even though freshell-terminal itself is clean).
- Produces: `pub(crate) const MIN_GEOMETRY_DIM: u16 = 2;` in `registry.rs`; floored-at-2 semantics for `resize`/`resize_for_attach` that Task 5's integration layer sits above.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Add to the existing `mod tests` in `crates/freshell-terminal/src/registry.rs`, next to the other resize tests (after `resize_updates_geometry_epoch_only_on_change`, :2657-2668, whose style these follow):

```rust
    #[test]
    fn resize_floors_dimensions_at_two_node_broker_parity() {
        // Node: recordTerminalGeometry floors both dims at 2 (broker.ts:672-673).
        let reg = TerminalRegistry::new();
        reg.insert_headless("T", "S");
        reg.resize("T", 0, 0); // first record: floored to (2,2), no epoch bump
        assert_eq!(reg.geometry("T"), Some((2, 2, 1)));
        reg.resize("T", 1, 1); // floors to (2,2): unchanged, no bump
        assert_eq!(reg.geometry("T"), Some((2, 2, 1)));
        reg.resize("T", 1, 40); // floors to (2,40): real change, bump
        assert_eq!(reg.geometry("T"), Some((2, 40, 2)));
        reg.resize("T", 2, 2); // exact minimum passes through unaltered
        assert_eq!(reg.geometry("T"), Some((2, 2, 3)));
        reg.resize("T", 95, 41); // normal values pass through unaltered
        assert_eq!(reg.geometry("T"), Some((95, 41, 4)));
    }

    #[test]
    fn resize_for_attach_floors_dimensions_at_two_node_broker_parity() {
        let reg = TerminalRegistry::new();
        reg.insert_headless("T", "S");
        let status =
            reg.resize_for_attach("T", 1, TerminalAttachIntent::ViewportHydrate, 0, 1);
        assert!(matches!(status, AttachResizeStatus::Resized));
        assert_eq!(reg.geometry("T"), Some((2, 2, 1))); // first record: no bump
        let status =
            reg.resize_for_attach("T", 1, TerminalAttachIntent::ViewportHydrate, 1, 2);
        assert!(matches!(status, AttachResizeStatus::Unchanged)); // floored dup
        assert_eq!(reg.geometry("T"), Some((2, 2, 1)));
        let status =
            reg.resize_for_attach("T", 1, TerminalAttachIntent::ViewportHydrate, 95, 41);
        assert!(matches!(status, AttachResizeStatus::Resized));
        assert_eq!(reg.geometry("T"), Some((95, 41, 2)));
    }
```

(If `TerminalAttachIntent`/`AttachResizeStatus` are not already in the tests module's imports, add them the same way the neighboring `resize_for_attach_*` tests at :2706-2807 import them — those tests already reference both types.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail (RED)**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-terminal resize_floors_dimensions_at_two_node_broker_parity resize_for_attach_floors_dimensions_at_two_node_broker_parity
```
Expected: both FAIL — e.g. `assertion failed: left == right, left: Some((0, 0, 1)), right: Some((2, 2, 1))` (raw values are currently stored unfloored).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the floor (GREEN)**

In `crates/freshell-terminal/src/registry.rs`, add near the top of the impl (just above `resize`, :1004):

```rust
    /// Node-parity geometry floor (`broker.ts:672-673`:
    /// `Math.max(2, Math.floor(Number.isFinite(cols) ? cols : 80))`). For
    /// `u16` input — always finite, always integral — the formula reduces
    /// exactly to `.max(2)`; the `floor` and non-finite-fallback arms are
    /// unrepresentable in the Rust type.
    pub(crate) const MIN_GEOMETRY_DIM: u16 = 2;
```

Then, at the top of `resize`'s body (:1005, before the lock — first lines of the function):
```rust
        let cols = cols.max(Self::MIN_GEOMETRY_DIM);
        let rows = rows.max(Self::MIN_GEOMETRY_DIM);
```

And identically at the top of `resize_for_attach`'s body (:1046, before the lock):
```rust
        let cols = cols.max(Self::MIN_GEOMETRY_DIM);
        let rows = rows.max(Self::MIN_GEOMETRY_DIM);
```

Placement matters: flooring BEFORE the `s.cols == cols && s.rows == rows` comparison matches Node, where `geometryChanged` compares NORMALIZED values against stored normalized values (`broker.ts:676-678`) — so a floored duplicate (e.g. `(1,1)` after `(0,0)`) is "unchanged" and does not bump the epoch. The floored values also flow to `pty.resize(cols, rows)`, so the PTY can never be driven below 2×2 — matching Node, where sub-2 values can never reach `pty.resize` at all (rejected upstream; see Task 5).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the crate's tests to verify green, no regressions**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-terminal
```
Expected: PASS — the 2 new tests plus the entire existing suite (baseline: green; all 13 existing geometry tests use dims ≥ 30, unaffected by the floor).

- [ ] **Step 5: Lint, format, commit**

```bash
cargo clippy -p freshell-terminal --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
git add crates/freshell-terminal/src/registry.rs
git commit -m "fix(rust): floor recorded terminal geometry at 2 (Node broker parity)"
```
Expected: clippy exit 0, commit succeeds.

### Task 5: WS boundary range rejection (Zod parity) + end-to-end proof

Node's authoritative dimension enforcement is the Zod protocol boundary (`shared/ws-protocol.ts:344-345, 364-365`): `terminal.attach` and `terminal.resize` require `cols ∈ [2, 1000]`, `rows ∈ [2, 500]`; out-of-range frames are **rejected** with an `error{code: INVALID_MESSAGE}` frame and never reach the registry (`ws-handler.ts:1856-1858`). Rust currently accepts any `i64` and squashes it with `clamp(0, u16::MAX)` (`terminal.rs:1781-1782, 1818-1819`), so `0`, `1`, `-50`, and `5000` all drive the PTY. Port the reject-not-clamp boundary. (Rust's `ErrorCode::InvalidMessage` already exists at `crates/freshell-protocol/src/common.rs:76` and serializes as `INVALID_MESSAGE`; `handle_tabs_push` already emits it on a runtime path, so this introduces no new error vocabulary.)

Node parity detail: Node's reject sends `requestId: msg?.requestId` — and neither `terminal.attach` nor `terminal.resize` HAS a `requestId` field (attach has `attachRequestId`, which Node does not copy into the error) — so the Rust error carries `request_id: None`. Exact parity, and simpler.

Scope note (recorded decision — see the load-bearing ledger): this task ports dimension RANGE parity for well-formed integer frames only. Frames that fail serde parsing entirely (non-integer `cols`, wrong types, malformed JSON) keep Rust's pre-existing accept-and-strip silent-drop behavior, where Node would reply `INVALID_MESSAGE` — recorded in Global Constraints' out-of-scope list; do not extend this task to parse-failure handling.

Line-number caution: Task 1's `large_enum_variant` fix at `terminal.rs:1906` shifts line numbers in this file — the `:NNNN` references below were taken BEFORE that fix. Locate every edit site by symbol/signature (e.g. `handle_resize`, the `TerminalAttach`/`TerminalResize` match arms in `handle_client_text`, `mod attach_geometry_tests`), not by raw line number.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs` — new consts + `terminal_dims_in_range` + `invalid_dims_error` helpers; guard the `TerminalAttach` dispatch arm (:473-476) and `TerminalResize` dispatch arm (:500-503) inside `handle_client_text` (where `ws_tx` is in scope); new in-file `#[cfg(test)]` mod
- Test (integration): `crates/freshell-ws/tests/attach_viewport_resize.rs` — 2 new `#[tokio::test]`s using the Task 2 harness

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: from Task 2's `common` module — `spawn_server`, `connect_and_capture_inventory`, `create_shell_terminal`, `attach_with`, `wait_for_attach_ready`, `next_frame_of_type` (signatures in Task 2's Produces block). From the existing codebase — `send(ws_tx, &msg).await` helper (`terminal.rs:75-80`), `ServerMessage::Error(ErrorMsg)` (`server_messages.rs:47-48`, `ErrorMsg` at :491-507), `ErrorCode::InvalidMessage` (`common.rs:76`), `crate::now_iso()`, `TerminalRegistry::geometry()`. Task 4's registry floor sits below this boundary as defense-in-depth (mirroring Node, where the broker floor sits below the Zod boundary and is equally unreachable from the wire).
- Produces: `pub(crate)` consts `MIN_TERMINAL_COLS/MAX_TERMINAL_COLS/MIN_TERMINAL_ROWS/MAX_TERMINAL_ROWS` and `pub(crate) fn terminal_dims_in_range(cols: i64, rows: i64) -> bool` in `freshell-ws`'s `terminal.rs`. No later task consumes them.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing unit tests**

Add a new in-file test module at the end of `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs`, following the crate's convention of narrow `#[cfg(test)]` mods (model: `mod attach_geometry_tests` at :2794, which unit-tests the pure helper `attach_geometry_identity_ok`):

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod terminal_dims_range_tests {
    use super::{invalid_dims_error, terminal_dims_in_range};

    #[test]
    fn rejects_zero_and_one_below_node_floor() {
        assert!(!terminal_dims_in_range(0, 24));
        assert!(!terminal_dims_in_range(80, 0));
        assert!(!terminal_dims_in_range(1, 24));
        assert!(!terminal_dims_in_range(80, 1));
        assert!(!terminal_dims_in_range(0, 0));
    }

    #[test]
    fn rejects_negative_values() {
        assert!(!terminal_dims_in_range(-1, 24));
        assert!(!terminal_dims_in_range(80, -50));
    }

    #[test]
    fn accepts_node_minimums_maximums_and_normal_values() {
        assert!(terminal_dims_in_range(2, 2)); // Zod .min(2)
        assert!(terminal_dims_in_range(80, 24));
        assert!(terminal_dims_in_range(95, 41));
        assert!(terminal_dims_in_range(1000, 500)); // Zod .max(1000)/.max(500)
    }

    #[test]
    fn rejects_values_above_node_ceiling() {
        assert!(!terminal_dims_in_range(1001, 500));
        assert!(!terminal_dims_in_range(1000, 501));
        assert!(!terminal_dims_in_range(i64::MAX, 24));
    }

    #[test]
    fn invalid_dims_error_serializes_as_invalid_message() {
        let value = serde_json::to_value(invalid_dims_error(0, -5)).expect("serialize");
        assert_eq!(value["type"], "error");
        assert_eq!(value["code"], "INVALID_MESSAGE");
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run unit tests to verify they fail (RED)**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws terminal_dims_range_tests
```
Expected: FAIL to compile — `cannot find function `terminal_dims_in_range``.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the validator and error helper (GREEN for unit tests)**

In `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs`, near the other module-level helpers (e.g. just above `handle_resize` at :1817), add:

```rust
/// Node-parity geometry bounds for `terminal.attach` / `terminal.resize`
/// (`shared/ws-protocol.ts:344-345, 364-365`): `cols` must be an integer in
/// `[2, 1000]` and `rows` in `[2, 500]`. Node enforces this at the Zod
/// boundary by REJECTING the frame with `INVALID_MESSAGE`
/// (`ws-handler.ts:1856-1858`) — reject, not clamp — so out-of-range
/// geometry never reaches the registry or the PTY.
pub(crate) const MIN_TERMINAL_COLS: i64 = 2;
pub(crate) const MAX_TERMINAL_COLS: i64 = 1000;
pub(crate) const MIN_TERMINAL_ROWS: i64 = 2;
pub(crate) const MAX_TERMINAL_ROWS: i64 = 500;

pub(crate) fn terminal_dims_in_range(cols: i64, rows: i64) -> bool {
    (MIN_TERMINAL_COLS..=MAX_TERMINAL_COLS).contains(&cols)
        && (MIN_TERMINAL_ROWS..=MAX_TERMINAL_ROWS).contains(&rows)
}

/// The `INVALID_MESSAGE` error frame for an out-of-range geometry reject.
/// `request_id` is `None` for exact Node parity: Node's Zod reject copies
/// `msg?.requestId` (`ws-handler.ts:1858`) and neither attach nor resize has
/// a `requestId` field.
fn invalid_dims_error(cols: i64, rows: i64) -> ServerMessage {
    ServerMessage::Error(ErrorMsg {
        code: ErrorCode::InvalidMessage,
        message: format!(
            "terminal geometry out of range: cols must be in [2, 1000] and rows in [2, 500] (got cols={cols}, rows={rows})"
        ),
        timestamp: crate::now_iso(),
        actual_session_ref: None,
        expected_session_ref: None,
        request_id: None,
        terminal_exit_code: None,
        terminal_id: None,
    })
}
```

The `ErrorMsg` field list above is from `server_messages.rs:491-507`; mirror the existing construction in `handle_kill` (`terminal.rs:1847-1862`) exactly — the compiler flags any field-name drift; keep every optional field `None`. Add whatever `use` items the file doesn't already import (it already imports `ServerMessage`; `ErrorMsg`/`ErrorCode` are already used by `handle_kill`/`handle_tabs_push` in this same file, so likely nothing new is needed).

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws terminal_dims_range_tests
```
Expected: PASS (5 tests).

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the failing integration tests (RED)**

First, add these two imports to the top of `crates/freshell-ws/tests/attach_viewport_resize.rs` (Task 2 moved the harness — the only prior user of these symbols — into `common/mod.rs` and removed them from this file as unused, so they MUST be re-added here or the RED run fails with a compile error instead of the expected runtime failures):

```rust
use futures_util::SinkExt;
use tokio_tungstenite::tungstenite::Message as WsMessage;
```

Then append the tests below (after the existing three tests; the harness comes from Task 2's `common`; the `ws.send(...)` style mirrors `common::attach_with` — copy it exactly):

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn out_of_range_resize_is_rejected_with_invalid_message() {
    // Node parity: terminal.resize cols/rows outside [2,1000]/[2,500] is
    // rejected at the boundary (ws-protocol.ts:364-365, ws-handler.ts:1856-1858)
    // and never reaches the registry — geometry and PTY stay untouched.
    let (url, registry) = spawn_server().await;
    let (mut ws, _inventory) = connect_and_capture_inventory(&url).await;
    let terminal_id = create_shell_terminal(&mut ws, "req-dims-resize").await;
    attach_with(&mut ws, &terminal_id, "att-dims-resize", "viewport_hydrate", 95, 41, None).await;
    wait_for_attach_ready(&mut ws, "att-dims-resize").await;
    let before = registry.geometry(&terminal_id);
    assert_eq!(before, Some((95, 41, 1)));

    let frame = serde_json::json!({
        "type": "terminal.resize",
        "terminalId": terminal_id,
        "cols": 0,
        "rows": 0,
    });
    ws.send(WsMessage::Text(frame.to_string())).await.expect("send resize");

    let err = next_frame_of_type(&mut ws, "error").await;
    assert_eq!(err["code"], "INVALID_MESSAGE");
    assert_eq!(registry.geometry(&terminal_id), before, "geometry must be untouched");
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn out_of_range_attach_geometry_is_rejected_with_invalid_message() {
    // Node parity: terminal.attach with cols=1 fails Zod validation, so the
    // ENTIRE attach is rejected — no attach.ready, no resize, no replay.
    let (url, registry) = spawn_server().await;
    let (mut ws, _inventory) = connect_and_capture_inventory(&url).await;
    let terminal_id = create_shell_terminal(&mut ws, "req-dims-attach").await;
    let before = registry.geometry(&terminal_id);

    attach_with(&mut ws, &terminal_id, "att-dims-attach", "viewport_hydrate", 1, 41, None).await;

    let err = next_frame_of_type(&mut ws, "error").await;
    assert_eq!(err["code"], "INVALID_MESSAGE");
    assert_eq!(registry.geometry(&terminal_id), before, "rejected attach must not resize");
}
```

(If the `WsMessage::Text(...)` construction in `common::attach_with` wraps the string differently — e.g. `.into()` — match it exactly; tokio-tungstenite 0.24's `Text` takes a `String`.)

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws --test attach_viewport_resize
```
Expected: the 3 existing tests PASS; the 2 new tests FAIL (`next_frame_of_type` panics with `no error frame within 20 messages` — no rejection exists yet, and in the first test `registry.geometry` will show the degenerate resize went through).

- [ ] **Step 5: Guard the dispatch arms (GREEN)**

In `handle_client_text` in `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs` (signature at :407-415 — `ws_tx: &mut WsSink` is in scope in the match arms), wrap the two existing arms. Two contracts govern the arm shape:

- **Both handlers are synchronous, `()`-returning `fn`s** (`fn handle_attach(...)` at :1757, `fn handle_resize(...)` at :1817). Do NOT add `.await` to either handler call — there is none today.
- **Every arm of this `match` evaluates to `bool`**: `handle_client_text` returns `bool`, and `false` makes the select-loop caller (:236) tear the connection down with `close_reason = "send_error"`. On the accept path keep the existing handler call and the existing `true` arm value byte-for-byte. On the reject path make the `send(...)` result the arm's value — exactly the `handle_kill` convention (:1847-1862, `send(ws_tx, &msg).await` as the tail expression) — so a socket-level send failure still closes the connection. Do not discard the `send` result with a `;`.

`TerminalResize` arm (currently `{ handle_resize(resize, state); true }` at :500-503):
```rust
        ClientMessage::TerminalResize(resize) => {
            if terminal_dims_in_range(resize.cols, resize.rows) {
                handle_resize(resize, state);
                true
            } else {
                send(ws_tx, &invalid_dims_error(resize.cols, resize.rows)).await
            }
        }
```

`TerminalAttach` arm (currently `{ handle_attach(attach, state, conn_id, conn_sink, terminal_output_batch_v1); true }` at :473-476) — same shape; preserve the handler invocation and its arguments byte-for-byte as they appear in the current arm (no `.await` — the handler is sync):
```rust
        ClientMessage::TerminalAttach(attach) => {
            if terminal_dims_in_range(attach.cols, attach.rows) {
                handle_attach(attach, state, conn_id, conn_sink, terminal_output_batch_v1);
                true
            } else {
                send(ws_tx, &invalid_dims_error(attach.cols, attach.rows)).await
            }
        }
```
(Borrow note: `resize`/`attach` are moved into the handler only on the accept path, and `cols`/`rows` are `Copy` `i64`s, so the reject path's field reads compile without clones.)

Guarding at the dispatch arm (before any handler logic, terminal lookup, or identity check) matches Node, where Zod validation precedes all message handling. Leave the existing `clamp(0, u16::MAX as i64) as u16` casts at :1781-1782 and :1818-1819 in place — post-validation they only ever see in-range values, and they remain the overflow-safe `i64 → u16` conversion (values are now guaranteed `≤ 1000`, so the cast is lossless).

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws --test attach_viewport_resize
```
Expected: PASS — all 5 tests (3 existing + 2 new).

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the full freshell-ws suite — no new failures**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-ws --no-fail-fast 2>&1 | tail -40
```
(`--no-fail-fast` is required: without it the run stops at the first failing test binary — `codex_session_ref_resume` — and never reaches the rest of the suite.)
Expected: only the 2 known baseline failures (`codex_session_ref_resume` tsx dependency; `session_identity_frames::fresh_claude_create_frames_carry_preallocated_session_ref` timeout). Everything else PASSES. In particular `term09_output_queue` must stay green — its `attach` helper hardcodes `cols: 80, rows: 24`, which is in-range.

- [ ] **Step 7: Lint, format, commit**

```bash
cargo clippy -p freshell-ws --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs crates/freshell-ws/tests/attach_viewport_resize.rs
git commit -m "fix(rust): reject out-of-range terminal.attach/resize geometry with INVALID_MESSAGE (Node Zod parity)"
```
Expected: clippy exit 0, commit succeeds.

### Task 6: Final validation sweep

Prove all three acceptance criteria on the finished branch. No code changes expected; if anything fails, fix it within this task (smallest change that restores the gate) and commit the fix with an appropriate `fix(rust):`/`style(rust):` message.

**Files:**
- Modify: none expected (verification only).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: all prior tasks' commits.
- Produces: a verified branch ready for the review stage.

- [ ] **Step 1: Acceptance 1 — clippy zero errors in freshell-platform (and everywhere touched)**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/attach-viewport-followups
cargo clippy -p freshell-platform -p freshell-terminal -p freshell-ws --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
Expected: exit 0, zero warnings.

- [ ] **Step 2: Acceptance 2 — dimension-floor parity tests pass**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-terminal resize_floors_dimensions_at_two_node_broker_parity resize_for_attach_floors_dimensions_at_two_node_broker_parity
cargo test -p freshell-platform spawn_dims_tests
cargo test -p freshell-ws terminal_dims_range_tests
cargo test -p freshell-ws --test attach_viewport_resize
```
Expected: all PASS (2 + 4 + 5 unit tests, 5 integration tests).

- [ ] **Step 3: Acceptance 3 — harness dedup with no new failures across the full Rust suite**

Run:
```bash
test -f crates/freshell-ws/tests/common/mod.rs && echo "common exists"
grep -c "async fn spawn_server" crates/freshell-ws/tests/attach_viewport_resize.rs crates/freshell-ws/tests/session_identity_frames.rs crates/freshell-ws/tests/common/mod.rs
cargo test -p freshell-platform
cargo test -p freshell-terminal
cargo test -p freshell-ws --no-fail-fast 2>&1 | tail -40
```
Expected: `common exists`; `spawn_server` count is `0` in both migrated test files and `1` in `common/mod.rs`; platform and terminal suites fully green; freshell-ws shows ONLY the 2 known baseline failures from Global Constraints (`--no-fail-fast` is required to reach all test binaries past the first known failure).

- [ ] **Step 4: Formatting and working-tree hygiene**

Run:
```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
git status --short
git log --oneline 55f58545..HEAD
```
Expected: fmt check clean; working tree clean (no uncommitted changes, no stray files); the log shows this plan's commits (plan doc + Tasks 1–5, plus any Task 6 fixes).

## Self-Review (performed at planning time)

1. **Spec coverage:** Follow-up 1 → Task 1 (ALL 14 diagnostics gating the plan's `-D warnings` invocations — the recorded "6" plus the lib-test one that `--all-targets` surfaces, plus 7 more in freshell-freshagent/freshell-ws that were masked by platform's compile-abort and are denied via workspace dep-denial; verified live, see the load-bearing ledger — eliminating them entirely, as required and then some). Follow-up 2 → Tasks 3+4+5 (the investigation found Node's floor is enforced at three layers — spawn falsy-coalesce, broker bookkeeping floor, Zod boundary reject — and each is ported to its exact Rust equivalent with boundary-value tests at 0, 1, 2, normal, and ceiling values; nothing invented). Follow-up 3 → Task 2 (single shared harness, both files migrated; donor is a clean win — 175 byte-identical lines). Acceptance 1/2/3 → Task 6 Steps 1/2/3.
2. **No silent deferrals:** the two out-of-scope items (broader test-file migration; `not_running` guard) are explicitly recorded in Global Constraints and are not spec requirements — the spec bounds migration to "the new attach-viewport tests, plus the donor file", both covered. No stubs, mocks, or fake seams anywhere: integration tests run a real WS server and real shell PTYs.
3. **Type consistency:** `terminal_dims_in_range(cols: i64, rows: i64)` matches the wire types (`TerminalResize`/`TerminalAttach` use `i64`, `client_messages.rs:239-240, 271-272`); registry floor operates on `u16` post-cast; `dim_or_default(Option<u16>, u16) -> u16` matches the three builders' parameters; `geometry() -> Option<(u16, u16, i64)>` assertions use that exact tuple shape; Task 5's integration tests consume exactly the signatures Task 2's Produces block declares.
4. **Load-bearing validation (post-planning, applied):** assumptions verified/falsified with live evidence in `.worktrees/.the-usual-logs/attach-viewport-followups/load-bearing-ledger.md`. Falsified and fixed here: (a) the clippy baseline is 14 workspace diagnostics, not 7 — Task 1 expanded, ordering constraint recorded (Task 1 first); (b) plain `cargo test -p freshell-ws` fail-fasts before reaching the full baseline — `--no-fail-fast` pinned on all full-suite comparisons. Verified: current-HEAD test baseline matches the recorded 2 failures (AVR 3/3 green); the SIF failure is deterministic (4/4 identical, ~5s), so Task 2's exact-match receipt is valid; the `#![allow(dead_code)]` exception is defensible (plan-scoped policy wording, 32 existing `allow(` precedents, standard tests/common idiom). Accepted (recorded decision): malformed-frame silent-drop divergence stays out of scope — see Global Constraints out-of-scope list and Task 5's scope note.
