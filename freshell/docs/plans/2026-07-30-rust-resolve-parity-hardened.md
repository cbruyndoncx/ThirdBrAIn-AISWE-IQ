# Rust Resolve-Session Parity with the Hardened (#586) Resume Contract — Implementation Plan

> `PARTIAL (2026-07-30, hardened-contract follow-up, commit 22022a848)`
> bullet of `docs/plans/2026-07-14-rust-tauri-parity-completion-checklist.md`).
> The text below is preserved as a HISTORICAL RECORD of the executed

> - **Pre-implementation assertions in the body describe the state BEFORE
>   execution, not HEAD.** Statements like "API X does not exist yet",
>   "Expected: compile FAILURE", and the Task 1 Step 4 drift findings were
>   true at planning time; every listed API/behavior has since LANDED, and
>   the RED-gate "expected failure" runs succeeded during execution and are
>   no longer reproducible at HEAD (the suites now compile and pass).
> - **The step checkboxes (`- [ ]`) are preserved in their historical
>   unchecked working form** — the executing workflow tracked per-task
>   completion externally (fresh implementer per task, spec + quality review
>   after each). They do NOT indicate pending work: every step of every task
>   was executed and committed.
> - **The branch's git history was subsequently REWORDED in place** (two
>   commit messages corrected; commit `6976f1caf` remapped the checklist
>   SHAs). `origin/feat/rust-resolve-parity` still holds the divergent

>   SHAs cited in the body (e.g. `c38422a0`) are superseded — see the

> - A few passages were corrected by post-review fix commits (home-resolution
>   parity via `provider_home()`; resolve admission rescoped to the fallback
>   dispatch) — the `POST-EXECUTION NOTE` blocks in the body mark where the
>   landed implementation diverged from the original planned text.
> - ERRATA (2026-07-31): the interim admission design (through `63bb31390`)
>   awaited the semaphore INSIDE the outer resolver blocking worker, so permit
>   starvation pinned an unbounded blocking-pool worker per dispatch for the
>   full deadline — the exhaustion the semaphore claimed to prevent; fixed by
>   this commit with synchronous fail-fast `try_acquire` admission before the
>   fallback task exists.
>
> **DO NOT EXECUTE.** Re-running these steps against HEAD would fail on
> already-landed APIs and unmet "expected failure" gates.

**Goal:** Bring the existing, rebased 16-commit Rust resolve-parity foundation (branch `feat/rust-resolve-parity`) up to the HARDENED resume contract that landed on main in PR #586 (merge `f903e8a6`), so the Rust `POST /api/sessions/resolve` is wire- and behavior-identical to the hardened Node implementation.

**Architecture:** This is an ADOPT-AND-EXTEND delta, not a rebuild. The rebase onto `f903e8a6` is already done (merge-base verified == `f903e8a6`); conflicts were resolved favoring main's hardened TS. The Node code AT THIS WORKTREE'S HEAD is therefore the authoritative truth to mirror: `shared/resume-resolve-contract.ts`, `shared/resume-input-parser.ts`, `server/coding-cli/resolve-session.ts`, `server/coding-cli/resolve-fallbacks.ts`, `server/coding-cli/providers/opencode-by-id-query.ts`, `server/sessions-router.ts` (lines 255–316). The Rust side to extend: `crates/freshell-sessions/src/{resume_input.rs,resume_resolve.rs}`, `crates/freshell-sessions/src/parse/opencode.rs`, `crates/freshell-sessions/src/directory_index.rs`, `crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs`, `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs`. The cross-language fixture `test/fixtures/resume-input/parser-cases.json` is the anti-drift keystone: it gets EXTENDED to the hardened parser behavior and BOTH implementations must pass it (the rebase silently dropped the TS side's fixture consumption — Task 2 restores it).

**Tech Stack:** Rust (axum, serde with `preserve_order`, rusqlite, regex, tokio), TypeScript (Node server, zod 4.3.6, vitest), Playwright e2e matrix (legacy-chromium + rust-chromium).

## Global Constraints

- NEVER touch ports 3001/3002 or any process you did not spawn (production server + live tabs run there). All server testing on ephemeral ports with throwaway HOMEs. Repeat this constraint to any subagent you dispatch.
- The MAIN checkout `/home/dan/code/freshell` has ~15 dirty files + untracked files from OTHER live sessions — never stage, stash, clean, or modify them. ALL work happens in the worktree `/home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/rust-resolve-parity` on branch `feat/rust-resolve-parity`.
- TS imports use NodeNext ESM: relative imports carry the `.js` extension.
- Coordinated tests: run `npm run test:status` before any broad vitest run; use `npm run test:vitest -- --config <config> <paths> --run` for focused runs; `cargo test -p <crate>` for Rust.
- Conventional commits, focused and atomic, each with the Amplifier footer:

  🤖 Generated with [Amplifier](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier)

  Co-Authored-By: Amplifier <240397093+microsoft-amplifier@users.noreply.github.com>
  ```

- Wire-shape parity constants (copy these EXACT values): `RESOLVE_MATCH_CAP = 20`, `MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES = 8`, `FALLBACK_BUDGET_PER_REQUEST = 2`, opencode by-id busy timeout `500` ms, known resume providers `["claude", "codex", "opencode", "amplifier"]`, scan-failure message literal `"session scan failed"`.
- `serde_json` has `preserve_order` enabled workspace-wide: struct field order IS wire key order. Field order in Rust wire structs must match the Node object literals.
- README.md is the only end-user markdown doc; this plan and the SYNC-06 checklist/spec under `docs/plans/` are working/agent docs.
- Branch may be pushed to origin at the end (Task 7). NO pull request without explicit user approval.

### Task 1: Verify post-rebase reality and the committed spec doc

The rebase resolved TS conflicts favoring main's hardened semantics. Before changing anything, pin down what actually compiles and passes NOW — the failures and drift found here are the worklist the later tasks close. The SYNC-06 spec doc is ALREADY COMMITTED (`docs/plans/2026-07-29-rust-resolve-parity-spec.md`, aligned to the hardened contract during plan review) — verify it, do not re-commit it.

**Files:**
- Read (already committed): `docs/plans/2026-07-29-rust-resolve-parity-spec.md`
- No file changes and NO commit in this task.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the rebased worktree at `feat/rust-resolve-parity` (merge-base == `f903e8a6`).
- Produces: a verified baseline (recorded in this task's completion report; later tasks' commit bodies may cite it): cargo workspace state, which resume suites pass, and the confirmed drift findings listed below.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm worktree identity and cleanliness**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/rust-resolve-parity
git branch --show-current && git merge-base HEAD f903e8a6f5e2e0e926890e38c28e775776fec7de && git status --porcelain
```
Expected: branch `feat/rust-resolve-parity`; merge-base prints `f903e8a6f5e2e0e926890e38c28e775776fec7de`; `git status --porcelain` prints NOTHING (clean tree — the spec doc is already committed). If there ARE dirty/untracked files or lock files, STOP and surface it — the worktree is not idle.

- [ ] **Step 2: Rust baseline**

Run (from the worktree root):
```bash
set -o pipefail
cargo test -p freshell-sessions -p freshell-server 2>&1 | tail -20
cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings 2>&1 | tail -5
```
(`set -o pipefail` is load-bearing on every piped cargo command in this plan: without it a failing `cargo` exits through `tail`'s success status.)
Expected: all tests pass and fmt/clippy are clean. The Rust side compiled at the old base and the rebase touched no Rust files' dependencies, so a failure here means the rebase broke something — investigate before proceeding (do not "fix forward" blind).

- [ ] **Step 3: TS baseline for the resume suites**

Run:
```bash
npm run test:status
npm run test:vitest -- --config config/vitest/vitest.config.ts test/unit/shared/resume-input-parser.test.ts --run
npm run test:vitest -- --config config/vitest/vitest.server.config.ts test/unit/server/coding-cli/resolve-session.test.ts test/unit/server/coding-cli/resolve-fallbacks.test.ts test/integration/server/sessions-resolve-router.test.ts --run
```
Expected: ALL PASS (these are main's hardened tests, untouched by the branch).

- [ ] **Step 4: Confirm the drift findings (read, don't fix — fixes are Tasks 2–6)**

Verify each of these against the code; they are the delta worklist:

> **POST-EXECUTION NOTE (2026-07-31):** the five drift findings below were the
> PRE-EXECUTION baseline, preserved verbatim. All five have since LANDED
> (Tasks 2–6): the TS test is fixture-driven again, the Rust parser carries
> the known-family regex + `MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES = 8`, the resolve core is
> the hardened per-token port (`Degraded`, `providerErrors`, case rules,
> subagent exclusion, budgeted shape-gated fallbacks), the opencode lookup is
> the direct by-id row query, and the wire response carries
> `providerErrors`/`unsearchedProviders`/`homeDir`. Checking these items
> against HEAD shows the OPPOSITE of what each asserts — that is the proof of
> completion, not a plan/code mismatch.

1. `test/unit/shared/resume-input-parser.test.ts` does NOT read `test/fixtures/resume-input/parser-cases.json` (the rebase kept main's inline version) — the anti-drift keystone is broken on the TS side even though both suites are green.
2. `crates/freshell-sessions/src/resume_input.rs` still has the generic `[a-z]{2,10}_[0-9A-Za-z]{8,40}` prefixed-id regex and NO candidate cap; the hardened TS parser (`shared/resume-input-parser.ts:29,37`) has the known-family regex and `MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES = 8`.
3. `crates/freshell-sessions/src/resume_resolve.rs` has status `Ready|Warming` only (no `Degraded`), no `providerErrors`, lowercases ALL tokens (ses_ ids must be case-SENSITIVE), does not exclude subagents from prefix discovery, runs the index pass for ALL tokens before ANY fallback (hardened order is per-token exact → fallback → prefix), has no fallback shape gates or per-request budget, and maps fallback read errors to a silent miss (the incident class).
4. `crates/freshell-sessions/src/parse/opencode.rs::opencode_session_directory_by_id` is the OLD #583 parent-walk; hardened Node (`opencode-by-id-query.ts`) is a direct by-id row query (archived + child sessions included, full row returned, errors PROPAGATE).
5. `crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs` response is `{status, matches, hint}` only; hardened wire adds `providerErrors`, `unsearchedProviders`, `homeDir` (`server/sessions-router.ts:306-314`), plus scan-failure merge, disabled-provider reporting, and degraded fire-and-forget refresh.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify the committed spec doc and record the baseline**

Run: `git log --oneline -1 -- docs/plans/2026-07-29-rust-resolve-parity-spec.md`
Expected: one commit line (the spec is tracked, nothing uncommitted). Open the spec and confirm its "Contract" bullet describes the HARDENED response (`ready|warming|degraded`, `providerErrors`, `unsearchedProviders`, `homeDir`) — it was aligned during plan review; if it still describes a `{status, matches, hint}`-only response, STOP and surface it. Record the Step 2–4 baseline findings (workspace state, suite results, confirmed drift list) in this task's completion report. NO commit in this task.

### Task 2: Extend the shared parser fixture to the hardened parser; both parsers pass it

The fixture table is the anti-drift mechanism. Extend it to the hardened TS parser's behavior, restore fixture consumption on the TS side, and port the hardened parser rules (known-family prefix regex, candidate cap 8) to Rust. One task because the fixture change necessarily goes red on one side until both parsers agree — the task is done only when BOTH suites are green against the SAME table.

**Files:**
- Modify: `test/fixtures/resume-input/parser-cases.json`
- Rewrite: `test/unit/shared/resume-input-parser.test.ts`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-sessions/src/resume_input.rs`
- Existing (unchanged): `crates/freshell-sessions/tests/resume_input_parser_parity.rs` (already fixture-driven)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `parseResumeInput` / `parse_resume_input` as they exist today.
- Produces: `pub const MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES: usize = 8` exported from `crates/freshell-sessions/src/resume_input.rs` (Task 3's core relies on the parser capping candidates; nothing else changes in the parser's public signature). TS `MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES` already exists.

- [ ] **Step 1: Rewrite the TS test to be fixture-driven (this is the failing test)**

Replace the ENTIRE contents of `test/unit/shared/resume-input-parser.test.ts` with:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest'
import { parseResumeInput, MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES } from '@shared/resume-input-parser'

interface FixtureCase {
  name: string
  input: string
  candidates: Array<{ token: string; kind: string }>
  hint: { provider: string; source: string } | null
}

const fixturePath = fileURLToPath(
  new URL('../../fixtures/resume-input/parser-cases.json', import.meta.url),
)
const fixture = JSON.parse(readFileSync(fixturePath, 'utf8')) as { cases: FixtureCase[] }

describe('parseResumeInput — shared cross-language fixture (SYNC-06 anti-drift)', () => {
  it('fixture is non-trivial', () => {
    expect(fixture.cases.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(31)
  })

  it.each(fixture.cases.map((c) => [c.name, c] as const))('%s', (_name, testCase) => {
    const parsed = parseResumeInput(testCase.input)
    expect(parsed.candidates).toEqual(testCase.candidates)
    expect(parsed.hint).toEqual(testCase.hint)
  })
})

describe('parseResumeInput — TS-only invariants', () => {
  // The cap VALUE is part of the server work-budget contract; the capping
  // BEHAVIOR is pinned by the fixture's cap case in both languages.
  it('MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES is 8', () => {
    expect(MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES).toBe(8)
  })
})
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it — expect FAIL (proves the keystone pins the TS parser again)**

Run: `npm run test:vitest -- --config config/vitest/vitest.config.ts test/unit/shared/resume-input-parser.test.ts --run`
Expected: FAIL on exactly one case — `non-ses prefixed id yields no id-shape hint` (`abc_12345678`): the hardened TS parser rejects unknown `abc_` families, so it returns NO candidates while the stale fixture expects one. Every other case passes.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update the fixture to the hardened parser's behavior**

In `test/fixtures/resume-input/parser-cases.json`:

3a. REPLACE the case named `"non-ses prefixed id yields no id-shape hint"` (the `abc_12345678` one) with:

```json
    {
      "name": "arbitrary snake_case prefix is not a known id family",
      "input": "abc_12345678",
      "candidates": [],
      "hint": null
    },
```

3b. APPEND these cases before the closing `]` (after the `"claude -rf ..."` case, adding a comma to that case's closing brace):

```json
    {
      "name": "arbitrary snake_case identifiers never match",
      "input": "my_function123 snake_casedword9",
      "candidates": [],
      "hint": null
    },
    {
      "name": "known thread_ id family",
      "input": "thread_abc123456",
      "candidates": [{ "token": "thread_abc123456", "kind": "prefixed-id" }],
      "hint": null
    },
    {
      "name": "known task_ id family with a long 46-char suffix",
      "input": "task_a1B2c3D4e5F6g7H8i9J0k1L2m3N4o5P6q7R8s9T0u1V2w3",
      "candidates": [
        { "token": "task_a1B2c3D4e5F6g7H8i9J0k1L2m3N4o5P6q7R8s9T0u1V2w3", "kind": "prefixed-id" }
      ],
      "hint": null
    },
    {
      "name": "candidates are capped at 8 (server work budget)",
      "input": "417e83450a00 417e83450a01 417e83450a02 417e83450a03 417e83450a04 417e83450a05 417e83450a06 417e83450a07 417e83450a08 417e83450a09 417e83450a10 417e83450a11",
      "candidates": [
        { "token": "417e83450a00", "kind": "hex-prefix" },
        { "token": "417e83450a01", "kind": "hex-prefix" },
        { "token": "417e83450a02", "kind": "hex-prefix" },
        { "token": "417e83450a03", "kind": "hex-prefix" },
        { "token": "417e83450a04", "kind": "hex-prefix" },
        { "token": "417e83450a05", "kind": "hex-prefix" },
        { "token": "417e83450a06", "kind": "hex-prefix" },
        { "token": "417e83450a07", "kind": "hex-prefix" }
      ],
      "hint": { "provider": "amplifier", "source": "id-shape" }
    }
```

(Verification notes for the case authors above, against `shared/resume-input-parser.ts`: `thread_abc123456` has an 9-char suffix within `{8,64}` and no agent word → prefixed-id candidate, no `ses_` prefix → hint null. The 46-char `task_` suffix is within `{8,64}` and beyond the OLD Rust regex's 40 cap. The 12 hex tokens are equal-length so the stable length sort keeps text order; the cap keeps the first 8; top candidate is a hex-prefix → amplifier id-shape hint.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the TS suite — expect PASS**

Run: `npm run test:vitest -- --config config/vitest/vitest.config.ts test/unit/shared/resume-input-parser.test.ts --run`
Expected: PASS (all fixture cases + TS-only invariants).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the Rust parity suite — expect FAIL (the fixture now leads the Rust parser)**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-sessions --test resume_input_parser_parity`
Expected: FAIL on `arbitrary snake_case prefix is not a known id family` (old generic regex still matches `abc_12345678`), `arbitrary snake_case identifiers never match`, `known task_ id family with a long 46-char suffix` (old regex caps the suffix at 40), and `candidates are capped at 8` (no cap yet).

- [ ] **Step 6: Port the hardened parser rules to Rust**

In `crates/freshell-sessions/src/resume_input.rs`:

6a. Replace the `PREFIXED_ID_RE` definition (and its comment) with:

```rust
// Known xxx_-prefixed id families only (ses_ + 26 base62 is opencode's,
// first-class). Arbitrary snake_case identifiers must NOT match: they would
// rank FIRST and waste resolver passes on non-ids. Mirrors
// `shared/resume-input-parser.ts:37`.
static PREFIXED_ID_RE: LazyLock<Regex> = LazyLock::new(|| {
    Regex::new(r"(?-u:\b)(?:ses|sess|session|thread|thr|run|msg|task|amp)_[0-9A-Za-z]{8,64}(?-u:\b)")
        .expect("static regex")
});
```

6b. Add the cap constant right below the type definitions (near `ResumeInputParse`):

```rust
/// Work budget: candidates are capped so one pasted blob can never trigger
/// unbounded server-side scans/DB lookups in the resolve endpoint.
/// Mirrors `MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES` (`shared/resume-input-parser.ts:29`).
pub const MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES: usize = 8;
```

6c. In `parse_resume_input`, replace the final two lines

```rust
    let hint = derive_hint(&sanitized, &candidates);
    ResumeInputParse { candidates, hint }
```

with:

```rust
    // Cap = work budget: bounds resolver scans + exact-id fallback lookups
    // per request. The hint derives from the CAPPED list (TS parity:
    // `deriveHint(sanitized, capped)`).
    candidates.truncate(MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES);
    let hint = derive_hint(&sanitized, &candidates);
    ResumeInputParse { candidates, hint }
```

Also update the doc comment on the `candidates` field of `ResumeInputParse` to say "capped at `MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES`".

- [ ] **Step 7: Run both sides — expect PASS**

Run:
```bash
cargo test -p freshell-sessions --test resume_input_parser_parity
npm run test:vitest -- --config config/vitest/vitest.config.ts test/unit/shared/resume-input-parser.test.ts --run
```
Expected: both PASS. Also run `cargo test -p freshell-sessions` and `cargo test -p freshell-server` — expect PASS (the old resolver consumes the parser output shape unchanged; if a resolver test relied on >8 candidates, fix the TEST input, not the cap).

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add test/fixtures/resume-input/parser-cases.json test/unit/shared/resume-input-parser.test.ts crates/freshell-sessions/src/resume_input.rs
git commit -m "feat(sessions): align resume-input parser to hardened #586 rules via the shared fixture

Fixture extended to the hardened parser (known-family prefix regex,
MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES=8 cap); TS test restored to fixture-driven form
(the rebase had kept main's inline version, silently unpinning the
keystone); Rust parser ported to the same rules. Both suites pass the
same table. (SYNC-06)

### Task 3: Hardened resolve core — ranking, case rules, subagents, sessionType default, provider-health channel, budgeted fallbacks

Rewrite `crates/freshell-sessions/src/resume_resolve.rs` as a step-for-step port of the HARDENED `server/coding-cli/resolve-session.ts` + the budget/shape-gate logic of `resolve-fallbacks.ts`. This is the core of the delta.

**Files:**
- Rewrite: `crates/freshell-sessions/src/resume_resolve.rs`
- Rewrite: `crates/freshell-sessions/tests/resume_resolve.rs` (mirror the hardened `test/unit/server/coding-cli/resolve-session.test.ts`)
- Modify (compile only): `crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs` — minimal adaptation so the workspace compiles; the full wire upgrade is Task 6.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `parse_resume_input` + `MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES` (Task 2), `IndexedSession` (`directory_index.rs`, has `is_subagent: bool`, `key() -> "{provider}:{session_id}"`).
- Produces (Tasks 4 and 6 depend on these EXACT names):
  - `pub enum ResumeResolveStatus { Ready, Warming, Degraded }` (serde lowercase)
  - `pub struct ResumeResolveProviderError { pub provider: String, pub code: Option<String>, pub message: Option<String> }` (camelCase wire, `code`/`message` omitted when `None`)
  - `pub struct ProviderFailure { pub code: Option<String>, pub message: String }`
  - `pub struct ClaudeTranscriptHit { pub session_id: String, pub cwd: Option<String> }` (unchanged)
  - `pub struct OpencodeByIdHit { pub session_id: String, pub cwd: Option<String>, pub title: Option<String>, pub last_activity_at: Option<i64> }`
  - `pub struct ResolveDeps<'a>` with fallback fields typed `Option<&'a (dyn Fn(&str) -> Result<Option<...Hit>, ProviderFailure> + Send + Sync)>`
  - `pub struct ResumeResolveOutcome { pub status: ResumeResolveStatus, pub matches: Vec<ResumeResolveMatch>, pub hint: Option<ResumeHint>, pub provider_errors: Vec<ResumeResolveProviderError> }`
  - `pub fn resolve_resume_input(input: &str, deps: &ResolveDeps<'_>) -> ResumeResolveOutcome`
  - `pub const RESOLVE_MATCH_CAP: usize = 20;` and `pub const FALLBACK_BUDGET_PER_REQUEST: usize = 2;`
  - The old `ResumeResolveResponse` struct is DELETED from this module (the wire response moves to `resolve.rs` in Task 6).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests (rewrite `crates/freshell-sessions/tests/resume_resolve.rs`)**

Mirror the hardened Node core suite `test/unit/server/coding-cli/resolve-session.test.ts` test-for-test (23 `it(...)` tests, no `it.each` — count verified at this worktree's HEAD; read it side-by-side while writing). Start the file with this header and helpers:

```rust
//! SYNC-06 logic-parity mirror of the HARDENED Node core suite
//! `test/unit/server/coding-cli/resolve-session.test.ts` (post-#586),
//! test-for-test. The HTTP wire (auth/validation/router merge) is pinned in
//! `crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs`.

Then write the tests. The COMPLETE code for the tests covering NEW hardened behavior (write these verbatim); for behaviors that already had a green mirror test in the old file (exact-wins-over-prefix, priority order of candidates, cap-20, dedupe-most-recent, warming, ready-empty, hint-alongside-evidence), carry the old test bodies over, adapting only the deps construction to the `resolve(...)` helper above and expected `session_type` values per the new default rule (index matches now ALWAYS carry `sessionType`, defaulting to the provider name):

The COMPLETE 23-test mapping to the Node suite (every `it(...)` title in `test/unit/server/coding-cli/resolve-session.test.ts` at this worktree's HEAD, in file order — the Rust suite must cover ALL 23; legend: ✎ = verbatim body given above, ↻ = carry over/adapt the old Rust test body, ✚ = write new from the stated expectation):

1. `exact match wins across all providers at once (claude UUID, no hint needed)` ✚ — index sessions for several providers, input = CLAUDE_ID → exactly 1 exact match; `hint` is the parser's id-shape derivation, `Some(ResumeHint { provider: Claude, source: IdShape })` — a bare v4 UUID ALWAYS derives the claude id-shape hint on both parsers (`shared/resume-input-parser.ts:88-94`, `resume_input.rs:194-202`). Do NOT assert `hint == None`: the Node title's "no hint needed" means no explicit command hint is required in the INPUT (the id shape alone suffices); the Node test body never asserts on `hint` at all.
2. `short hex prefix matches the amplifier session (spec row: 417e8345)` ✚ — index an amplifier session `417e8345aaaa`, input `417e8345` → 1 prefix match.
3. `exact-id match is case-insensitive for UUID/hex tokens` ✎ `exact_id_match_is_case_insensitive_for_uuid_hex_tokens`
4. `ses_ ids are case-SENSITIVE (base62): a case-variant does NOT match` ✎ `ses_ids_are_case_sensitive_a_case_variant_does_not_match`
5. `opencode ses_ id resolves to opencode even though other providers exist` ✚ — index sessions for all four providers incl. the SES_ID opencode row, input = SES_ID → 1 exact opencode match.
6. `exact match takes precedence over prefix matches of the same token` ↻
7. `ambiguous prefix returns all matches most-recent first, capped` ↻ — build 25 sessions with a shared prefix, assert 20 back (`RESOLVE_MATCH_CAP`), sorted by `last_activity_at` desc.
8. `tries candidates in priority order until one resolves` ↻
9. `an EXACT id finds a subagent/child session (spec: scan ALL sessions)` ✎ `an_exact_id_finds_a_subagent_child_session`
10. `prefix DISCOVERY does not surface subagent sessions` ✎ `prefix_discovery_does_not_surface_subagent_sessions`
11. `an exact FALLBACK hit beats an indexed PREFIX match of the same token` ✎ `an_exact_fallback_hit_beats_an_indexed_prefix_match_of_the_same_token`
12. `sessionType defaults to the provider name when the index has none` ✎ `session_type_defaults_to_the_provider_name_when_the_overlay_has_none`
13. `index miss consults exact-id fallbacks (claude transcript locator)` ✚ — empty index, input = OTHER_UUID, claude fallback returns a hit with cwd → 1 exact `claude` match carrying the cwd.
14. `index miss consults opencode by-id fallback` ✎ `opencode_fallback_hit_carries_title_and_floored_last_activity` (covers it with richer asserts — keep them)
15. `zero matches when nothing resolves anywhere` ↻ — ready-empty for garbage input.
16. `a THROWING fallback never fails the request: it degrades with a provider error summary` ✎ `a_failing_fallback_never_fails_the_resolve_it_degrades_with_a_provider_error`
17. `provider identity in providerErrors comes from the fallback PAIR, not its position` ✎ `provider_identity_travels_with_the_fallback_not_its_position`
18. `a typed ClaudeTranscriptLocatorError surfaces its errno code in the provider error` ✚ — claude fallback returns `Err(ProviderFailure { code: Some("EACCES"), .. })` on a uuid token → `provider_errors[0].code == Some("EACCES")` (Rust models Node's typed error as `ProviderFailure.code`).
19. `a healthy resolve reports NO provider errors` ✎ `a_healthy_resolve_reports_no_provider_errors_and_stays_ready`
20. `a failed exact-id fallback does NOT hide a later lower-priority match — but marks the response degraded` ✎ `a_failed_fallback_does_not_hide_a_later_lower_priority_match_but_marks_degraded`
21. `a fallback exact hit for a HIGHER-priority token beats an indexed exact hit of a LOWER-priority token` ✎ `a_fallback_exact_hit_for_a_higher_priority_token_beats_an_indexed_exact_of_a_lower_one`
22. `dedupes duplicate (provider, sessionId) snapshot entries, keeping the most recent` ↻
23. `returns warming (not "not found") while the index is not ready` ↻ — `sessions: None`, assert `provider_errors` empty too.

ALSO keep the Rust-only additions given verbatim above that have no Node twin (`shape_gates_wrong_shape_tokens_do_no_fallback_work`, `fallback_work_is_budgeted_to_two_calls_per_request_per_provider`, `wrong_shape_tokens_consume_no_budget`) and the old file's hint-alongside-evidence carryover — the suite therefore ends up with MORE than 23 tests; the 23 above are the mirror contract.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run — expect compile FAILURE (new API does not exist yet)**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-sessions --test resume_resolve`
Expected: compile errors (`OpencodeByIdHit`, `ProviderFailure`, `ResumeResolveOutcome`, `Degraded` unknown).

> **POST-EXECUTION NOTE (2026-07-31):** historical RED gate — the compile
> failure occurred as expected during execution, and Step 3's implementation
> then landed (commit `5a3332be3`). It is NOT reproducible at HEAD: the named
> APIs all exist now, and this suite compiles and passes.

- [ ] **Step 3: Rewrite `crates/freshell-sessions/src/resume_resolve.rs`**

Replace the whole file with (keep the existing module doc, updating its second paragraph to note the hardened contract):

```rust
//! Rust port of the HARDENED (#586) `server/coding-cli/resolve-session.ts` +
//! the shape-gate/budget logic of `resolve-fallbacks.ts` — the resume-by-id
//! resolve core. Pure and synchronous: the HTTP layer
//! (`crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs`) supplies the index snapshot, the
//! sessionType overlay map, and the two exact-id fallback closures, then
//! merges router-level fields (scan failures, unsearchedProviders, homeDir)
//! and serializes.
//!
//! Wire parity notes:
//! - Field ORDER in `ResumeResolveMatch` matches the Node object literals —
//!   `serde_json` `preserve_order` + struct field order drive output order.
//! - Optional match fields are OMITTED when `None` (Node drops `undefined`);
//!   `hint` is `null` when absent (zod `.nullable()`), so NOT skip-serialized.
//! - Per-token resolution order (resolve-session.ts:56-70): exact index hits
//!   (ALL sessions, subagents included) → exact-id fallbacks → prefix
//!   discovery (top-level only). A prefix match must NEVER outrank any exact
//!   resolution of the same or a higher-priority token.
//! - UUID/hex-family tokens (hex digits + dashes only) match
//!   case-INSENSITIVELY; everything else — notably ses_ base62 ids — matches
//!   case-SENSITIVELY (base62 case-folding could resolve the WRONG session).
//! - Provider failure ≠ not found: a failing fallback records a per-provider
//!   error and the result becomes `degraded` — never a silent empty miss.

```

Note the key `overlay_or` uses `IndexedSession.key()`'s format; if `key()` exists use `session.key()` for the index path (it does — `directory_index.rs:86`) — either spelling is fine as long as the format is `"{provider}:{session_id}"`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Minimal compile adaptation of the HTTP layer (behavior parity deferred to Task 6)**

`crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs` no longer compiles (old `ResumeResolveResponse`, `OpencodeDirLookup` closure types). Make the smallest change that keeps current wire behavior while compiling against the new core, so this task stays reviewable on its own:

- Change the two lookup type aliases to the new fallible forms:
  ```rust
  pub type OpencodeByIdLookup =
      Arc<dyn Fn(&str) -> Result<Option<OpencodeByIdHit>, ProviderFailure> + Send + Sync>;
  pub type ClaudeLocator =
      Arc<dyn Fn(&str) -> Result<Option<ClaudeTranscriptHit>, ProviderFailure> + Send + Sync>;
  ```
  and rename the state field `opencode_dir_by_id` → `opencode_session_by_id` (imports: `OpencodeByIdHit`, `ProviderFailure`, `ResumeResolveOutcome` from `freshell_sessions::resume_resolve`; drop the now-unused `OpencodeSessionDirectory` import).
- In the handler, build `ResolveDeps` with the renamed fields and serialize a TEMPORARY wire struct locally so today's `{status, matches, hint}` shape is preserved until Task 6:
  ```rust
  #[derive(serde::Serialize)]
  struct LegacyWire {
      status: freshell_sessions::resume_resolve::ResumeResolveStatus,
      matches: Vec<freshell_sessions::resume_resolve::ResumeResolveMatch>,
      hint: Option<freshell_sessions::resume_input::ResumeHint>,
  }
  ```
  mapping the outcome's fields into it (drop `provider_errors` for now) — and mark it `// TASK-6: replaced by the full hardened wire response`.
- In `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs`, update the two closures to the new signatures MINIMALLY (same silent-miss behavior for now, full health channel in Task 6):
  ```rust
  opencode_session_by_id: Some(std::sync::Arc::new(|session_id: &str| {
      let data_home = freshell_sessions::parse::default_opencode_data_home();
      Ok(freshell_sessions::parse::opencode_session_directory_by_id(&data_home, session_id)
          .ok()
          .flatten()
          .map(|hit| freshell_sessions::resume_resolve::OpencodeByIdHit {
              session_id: session_id.to_string(),
              cwd: hit.directory,
              title: None,
              last_activity_at: None,
          }))
  })),
  locate_claude_transcript: Some(std::sync::Arc::new(|session_id: &str| {
      let lowered = session_id.to_ascii_lowercase();
      Ok(freshell_freshagent::locate_transcript(&lowered).map(|path| {
          freshell_sessions::resume_resolve::ClaudeTranscriptHit {
              session_id: lowered.clone(),
              cwd: freshell_freshagent::transcript_cwd(&path),
          }
      }))
  })),
  ```
- Update `resolve.rs`'s in-module tests only as far as compilation requires (closure signatures gain `Ok(...)`; the exact-match test's expected JSON gains `"sessionType": "claude"` — the new provider-name default is intentionally visible on the wire NOW, it matches hardened Node).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the suites**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-sessions --test resume_resolve && cargo test -p freshell-server && cargo test -p freshell-sessions`
Expected: ALL PASS. Then `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` — clean.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-sessions/src/resume_resolve.rs crates/freshell-sessions/tests/resume_resolve.rs crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs
git commit -m "feat(sessions): hardened #586 resolve core — per-token ranking, case rules, provider-health channel, budgeted fallbacks

### Task 4: Hardened opencode exact-id lookup — direct by-id row query replacing the parent walk

Hardened Node replaced the #583 `resolveOpencodeSessionRoots` parent-walk with a direct by-id sqlite row query (`server/coding-cli/providers/opencode-by-id-query.ts`): archived and CHILD sessions included, full row returned (title/timestamps), errors PROPAGATE (provider unavailable ≠ not found). Port it.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-sessions/src/parse/opencode.rs` (add `OpencodeByIdRow` + `opencode_session_row_by_id`; DELETE `opencode_session_directory_by_id`, its `SessionRow`/`fetch_session_row` helpers, and the `OpencodeSessionDirectory` struct once nothing references them — grep first: `grep -rn "OpencodeSessionDirectory\|opencode_session_directory_by_id" crates/ --include=*.rs`)
- Rewrite: `crates/freshell-sessions/tests/opencode_directory_by_id.rs` → delete and create `crates/freshell-sessions/tests/opencode_row_by_id.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-sessions/src/parse/mod.rs` (export the new names, drop the old)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: rusqlite (already a dependency; the pinned 0.31.0 exposes `Error::sqlite_error_code()`) and the existing `to_opt_string`/`to_opt_i64` helpers in the same file.
- Produces (Task 6 wires this): `pub fn opencode_session_row_by_id(data_home: &Path, session_id: &str) -> Result<Option<OpencodeByIdRow>, OpencodeByIdError>`, `pub struct OpencodeByIdError { pub code: Option<String>, pub message: String }` (code-preserving — see Step 2; the existing `OpencodeReadError` stays untouched for its other consumers), and `pub struct OpencodeByIdRow { pub session_id: String, pub cwd: Option<String>, pub title: Option<String>, pub created_at: Option<i64>, pub last_activity_at: Option<i64>, pub project_path: Option<String> }`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests (`crates/freshell-sessions/tests/opencode_row_by_id.rs`)**

Reuse the DB-fixture helpers from the old `opencode_directory_by_id.rs` (it builds real sqlite files in temp dirs — copy its `temp dir` + schema-setup helpers verbatim, adjusting the schema to include `time_created`, `time_updated`, `time_archived`, `title` columns and a `project` table). Test set (complete expectations; adapt helper names to what you copied):

> **POST-EXECUTION NOTE (2026-07-31):** this block is a behavioral SPEC, not a
> paste-ready verifier — every body below ends in `unimplemented!()` so a literal
> paste FAILS loudly instead of passing vacuously. The real assertions landed,
> under these exact test names, in
> `crates/freshell-sessions/tests/opencode_row_by_id.rs`; read that file for the
> executable versions.

```rust
//! Hardened (#586) opencode exact-id lookup parity: mirrors
//! `server/coding-cli/providers/opencode-by-id-query.ts` — a DIRECT by-id
//! row query. Unlike the #583 parent-walk it includes ARCHIVED and CHILD
//! sessions, returns the full row (title/timestamps), and PROPAGATES read
//! errors (provider unavailable ≠ not found).

    // a valid fixture db with one row, open a SECOND rusqlite Connection to

    // commit); now call opencode_session_row_by_id → expect Err with code
    // Some("SQLITE_BUSY") (the busy error surfaces as OpencodeByIdError once
    // the 500 ms busy_timeout expires — the read-only open cannot acquire
    // the shared lock). Optionally assert the call took >= ~400 ms to show
    // the timeout (not an instant failure), then ROLLBACK/drop the writer

    unimplemented!("spec only — landed as this test name in opencode_row_by_id.rs");
}

    unimplemented!("spec only — landed as this test name in opencode_row_by_id.rs");
}
```

Write each body out fully using the copied helpers (they are short rusqlite calls; the old test file shows the pattern), REPLACING every `unimplemented!()` marker with the real fixture setup + assertions described in its comment — a body left as `unimplemented!()` fails the test run, by design. Run: `cargo test -p freshell-sessions --test opencode_row_by_id` — expected: compile FAILURE (function does not exist). (Post-execution: all ten bodies landed with real assertions in `crates/freshell-sessions/tests/opencode_row_by_id.rs`.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement `opencode_session_row_by_id`**

In `crates/freshell-sessions/src/parse/opencode.rs`, add:

```rust
/// SHORT busy timeout (`opencode-by-id-query.ts:12`): a locked DB must fail
/// FAST — the failure surfaces as provider-unavailable, never "not found".
const OPENCODE_BYID_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS: u64 = 500;

/// Code-PRESERVING error for the by-id query (the plain `OpencodeReadError`

/// serializes only `{name, message}`; `opencode-by-id-runner.ts:103-106`
/// rebuilds the Error without `.code`), so the code never reaches the wire.
/// We keep the code HERE for structured logging and precise messages; the

(`to_opt_i64` already truncates REAL toward zero via `as i64`; epoch-ms values are positive so truncation == `Math.floor` — same note the listing query carries.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Delete the old walk**

Grep consumers: `grep -rn "OpencodeSessionDirectory\|opencode_session_directory_by_id" crates/ --include=*.rs`. Expected remaining consumers after Task 3: only `parse/mod.rs` exports and possibly a leftover import in `resolve.rs`'s doc comments/tests. Delete `opencode_session_directory_by_id`, `fetch_session_row`, the `SessionRow` alias, and `OpencodeSessionDirectory`; delete `crates/freshell-sessions/tests/opencode_directory_by_id.rs`; update `parse/mod.rs` exports (`opencode_session_row_by_id`, `OpencodeByIdRow` in; old names out). Update the Task-3 temporary closure in `main.rs` to the new query:

```rust
opencode_session_by_id: Some(std::sync::Arc::new(|session_id: &str| {
    let data_home = freshell_sessions::parse::default_opencode_data_home();
    match freshell_sessions::parse::opencode_session_row_by_id(&data_home, session_id) {
        Ok(row) => Ok(row.map(|r| freshell_sessions::resume_resolve::OpencodeByIdHit {
            session_id: r.session_id,
            cwd: r.cwd,
            title: r.title,
            last_activity_at: r.last_activity_at,
        })),
        // TASK-6 upgrades this to Err(ProviderFailure{..}) once the wire
        // carries providerErrors; until then a read failure stays a miss.
        Err(_) => Ok(None),
    }
})),
```

Also update `resolve.rs`'s in-module opencode fallback test to return an `OpencodeByIdHit` (the old `OpencodeSessionDirectory` literal no longer exists) and extend its expected match JSON with the row-borne fields it now passes (`title`, `lastActivityAt`) if the test supplies them.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-sessions && cargo test -p freshell-server && cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
Expected: ALL PASS, clean.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash

### Task 5: SessionIndex scan-failure channel + fire-and-forget refresh + settings enabled-providers getter

Node's route merges `codingCliIndexer.getScanFailures()` into `providerErrors` and fire-and-forgets `requestRefresh()` on degraded (`sessions-router.ts:293-305`). Give the Rust `SessionIndex` the same two capabilities, and `SettingsStore` an enabled-providers reader.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-sessions/src/directory_index.rs`
- Modify: `crates/freshell-sessions/src/amplifier.rs` (provider_name + discover_checked on the amplifier source)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/settings_store.rs` (getter below, AND: the legacy-default migration's hard-coded `const DEFAULTS: [&str; 3] = ["claude", "codex", "opencode"]` (`settings_store.rs`, load-time migration ~lines 180-196) widens to `[&str; 4]` adding `"amplifier"` — it must mirror Node's four-provider `DEFAULT_ENABLED_CLI_PROVIDERS` (`shared/coding-cli-defaults.ts:1-3`), otherwise a persisted legacy `["claude", "codex"]` list gains amplifier on Node but stays amplifier-less on Rust, leaving the provider unsearched and its indexed sessions filtered out; the migration's existing exact-legacy-match + gating logic is otherwise UNCHANGED)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/settings.rs` (default `enabled_providers` gains `"amplifier"` — Node-default parity)
- Test: unit tests inside `directory_index.rs`'s existing `#[cfg(test)]` module (follow its current test patterns) and `settings_store.rs`'s.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: existing `SessionSource` trait, `refresh_snapshot` free function, `spawn_background_refresh`.
- Produces (Task 6 depends on these EXACT names):
  - `SessionSource::provider_name(&self) -> Option<&'static str>` (default `None`; the FOUR real sources all participate: `ClaudeSource` → `Some("claude")`, `CodexSource` → `Some("codex")`, `OpencodeSource` → `Some("opencode")`, the amplifier source in `amplifier.rs` → `Some("amplifier")`)
  - `SessionSource::discover_checked(&self) -> Result<Vec<FileStat>, std::io::Error>` (default `Ok(self.discover())`; the file-backed sources override it to PROPAGATE a root-listing failure — see Step 2)
  - `SessionIndex::scan_failures(&self) -> Vec<String>` (sorted, deduped)
  - `SessionIndex::request_refresh(&self)` (non-blocking, no-op if a sweep is already running)
  - `SettingsStore::coding_cli_enabled_providers(&self) -> Vec<String>` — **async** (`pub async fn`): `ServerSettings` lives in a `tokio::sync::RwLock`, so the getter mirrors `get()` (`self.inner.read().await...`); a sync getter is impossible without `blocking_read`, which can panic inside the runtime. (`session_overrides()` is NOT the pattern here — it reads a separate `std::sync::Mutex`.)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `directory_index.rs`'s test module (reuse its existing fixture-source pattern — the file has test sources; model on them):

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn a_failing_direct_list_records_a_scan_failure_and_recovery_clears_it() {
    // A direct-listed source whose direct_list() can be toggled to Err.
    struct FlakySource(std::sync::Arc<std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool>);
    impl SessionSource for FlakySource {
        fn discover(&self) -> Vec<FileStat> { Vec::new() }
        fn parse(&self, _p: &Path) -> Option<IndexedSession> { None }
        fn provider_name(&self) -> Option<&'static str> { Some("opencode") }
        // A CHANGING token each call, so every sweep re-queries.
        fn direct_change_token(&self) -> Option<i64> {
            use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicI64, Ordering};
            static N: AtomicI64 = AtomicI64::new(0);
            Some(N.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst))
        }
        fn direct_list(&self) -> Result<Vec<IndexedSession>, String> {
            if self.0.load(std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst) {
                Err("unable to open database file".to_string())
            } else {
                Ok(Vec::new())
            }
        }
    }
    let broken = std::sync::Arc::new(std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool::new(true));
    let index = SessionIndex::with_ttl_and_cache_path(
        vec![std::sync::Arc::new(FlakySource(std::sync::Arc::clone(&broken))) as _],
        std::time::Duration::ZERO, // every snapshot() sweeps
        None,
    );
    // COLD cache: the first snapshot() sweeps INLINE, so this assert is
    // deterministic.
    let _ = index.snapshot().await;
    assert_eq!(index.scan_failures(), vec!["opencode".to_string()]);
    broken.store(false, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst);
    // WARM-but-stale cache: snapshot() returns stale data immediately and
    // refreshes DETACHED (stale-while-revalidate) — recovery must be observed
    // by POLLING. Reuse the module's existing `wait_until` test helper.
    let _ = index.snapshot().await;
    assert!(
        wait_until(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2), || index.scan_failures().is_empty()).await,
        "scan failure must clear once the source recovers"
    );
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn a_failing_file_backed_root_listing_records_a_scan_failure_too() {
    // FILE-BACKED parity (Node records listSessionFiles() throws for claude/
    // codex/amplifier in scanFailures — session-indexer.ts:1250-1262 — and the
    // route turns them into degraded providerErrors): a source whose
    // discover_checked() errs must be recorded, NOT silently treated as an
    // empty listing.
    struct FlakyFileSource(std::sync::Arc<std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool>);
    impl SessionSource for FlakyFileSource {
        fn discover(&self) -> Vec<FileStat> { Vec::new() }
        fn discover_checked(&self) -> Result<Vec<FileStat>, std::io::Error> {
            if self.0.load(std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst) {
                Err(std::io::Error::new(std::io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied, "denied"))
            } else {
                Ok(Vec::new())
            }
        }
        fn parse(&self, _p: &Path) -> Option<IndexedSession> { None }
        fn provider_name(&self) -> Option<&'static str> { Some("claude") }
    }
    let broken = std::sync::Arc::new(std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool::new(true));
    let index = SessionIndex::with_ttl_and_cache_path(
        vec![std::sync::Arc::new(FlakyFileSource(std::sync::Arc::clone(&broken))) as _],
        std::time::Duration::ZERO,
        None,
    );
    let _ = index.snapshot().await; // cold sweep is INLINE — deterministic
    assert_eq!(index.scan_failures(), vec!["claude".to_string()]);
    broken.store(false, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst);
    let _ = index.snapshot().await; // stale-while-revalidate: poll for recovery
    assert!(
        wait_until(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2), || index.scan_failures().is_empty()).await,
        "file-backed scan failure must clear once the root is listable again"
    );
}
```

And for the settings getter (in `settings_store.rs` tests, following its temp-home pattern; `#[tokio::test]` since the getter is async): load a store from a temp home whose `<home>/.freshell/config.json` contains the WRAPPED document `{"version":1,"settings":{"codingCli":{"enabledProviders":["claude","opencode"]}}}` (SettingsStore reads `config.json` and unwraps the top-level `settings` key — see `load_full_settings`; there is NO `settings.json`), assert `coding_cli_enabled_providers().await` returns exactly that; and for a FRESH temp home (no config file) assert the returned list is exactly `["claude", "codex", "opencode", "amplifier"]` — Node's authoritative `DEFAULT_ENABLED_CLI_PROVIDERS` (`shared/coding-cli-defaults.ts:3`). This assertion FAILS against today's Rust default, which omits `amplifier` (`crates/freshell-server/src/settings.rs:38-44`) — that is a live parity defect this task closes in Step 2; do NOT weaken the assert to whatever the store currently returns. ALSO add a legacy-MIGRATION test in the same module (same temp-home pattern): persist a config whose `enabledProviders` is exactly the legacy pair `["claude", "codex"]`, load the store, and assert the migrated list gains `"amplifier"` under exactly the same conditions it already gains `"opencode"` (same availability gating the existing migration applies — mirror whatever the current opencode migration test asserts, extended to amplifier). This test FAILS against today's three-item `const DEFAULTS` in `settings_store.rs` — the second half of the same parity defect (Node migrates legacy lists using the four-provider `DEFAULT_ENABLED_CLI_PROVIDERS`, `server/settings-migrate.ts:35-46`).

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-sessions directory_index && cargo test -p freshell-server settings_store` — expected: compile FAILURE (methods missing).

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement**

- `SessionSource` trait: add
  ```rust
  /// Provider identity for scan-failure reporting (`getScanFailures` parity).
  /// `None` (default) = this source does not participate in failure tracking.
  fn provider_name(&self) -> Option<&'static str> {
      None
  }

  /// Discovery with ROOT-listing failure propagation (Node parity: a
  /// throwing `listSessionFiles()` is RECORDED in scanFailures —
  /// `session-indexer.ts:1250-1262` — never silently treated as empty).
  /// Default wraps the infallible `discover()` for test sources.
  fn discover_checked(&self) -> Result<Vec<FileStat>, std::io::Error> {
      Ok(self.discover())
  }
  ```
  Implement `provider_name` = `Some("claude")`/`Some("codex")`/`Some("opencode")`/`Some("amplifier")` on the FOUR real sources (the amplifier source lives in `amplifier.rs`). Override `discover_checked` on the file-backed sources (claude `directory_index.rs:204-208`, codex `directory_index.rs:374-377`, amplifier `amplifier.rs:108-111`) to PROPAGATE the top-level root `read_dir` error instead of the current `else { return Vec::new() }` swallow (a missing root — `NotFound`/`NotADirectory` — stays `Ok(vec![])`: an absent provider is a genuine empty, matching Node's ENOENT tolerance; EACCES/EIO propagate). Per-file/nested errors stay tolerant — corruption-tolerance within a listable root is preserved.
- `SessionIndex`: add field `scan_failures: Arc<StdMutex<HashSet<String>>>` (init empty in `with_ttl_and_cache_path`); pass `Arc::clone` of it into both `refresh_snapshot` call sites (inline + background — extend the free function's parameter list). Inside `refresh_snapshot`, for every source whose `provider_name()` is `Some(name)`: in the direct-listed branch, on `Ok` `set.remove(name)` / on `Err` `set.insert(name.to_string())`; in the file-backed branch, call `discover_checked()` instead of `discover()` — on `Ok(stats)` `set.remove(name)` and proceed as today, on `Err(_)` `set.insert(name.to_string())` and treat the listing as empty for this sweep. NODE PARITY NOTE (document in a comment on `scan_failures()`): Node behaves exactly this way — a throwing `listSessionFiles()` also yields an empty file list and lets the full-scan prune drop that provider's cached entries (`session-indexer.ts:1467-1475`, `:1499-1504`); what makes the outage VISIBLE is the recorded scan failure, which the route merges into `providerErrors` and marks the response `degraded` — never a silent healthy `ready + matches: []`. Both direct-listed (opencode) and file-backed (claude/codex/amplifier) outages must therefore be recorded.
- Public accessors on `SessionIndex`:
  ```rust
  /// Providers whose MOST RECENT listing attempt failed (unsearchable, not
  /// empty) — `codingCliIndexer.getScanFailures()` parity.
  pub fn scan_failures(&self) -> Vec<String> {
      let mut names: Vec<String> = self.scan_failures.lock().unwrap().iter().cloned().collect();
      names.sort();
      names
  }

  /// Fire-and-forget refresh (`requestRefresh` parity): gives a degraded
  /// response's Retry a chance to converge once a failed provider recovers.
  /// No-op if a sweep is already running.
  pub fn request_refresh(&self) {
      if let Ok(guard) = Arc::clone(&self.refresh_lock).try_lock_owned() {
          self.spawn_background_refresh(guard);
      }
  }
  ```
- `SettingsStore` getter — ASYNC, mirroring `get()` (`ServerSettings` lives in `Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<..>>`; `session_overrides()` is NOT the pattern — it reads a separate `std::sync::Mutex`, and `blocking_read` in an async context can panic):
  ```rust
  /// The enabled coding-CLI provider names (`settings.codingCli.enabledProviders`)
  /// — the resolve route's unsearched-provider computation reads this. Async
  /// because the settings tree is behind a tokio RwLock (same as `get()`).
  pub async fn coding_cli_enabled_providers(&self) -> Vec<String> {
      self.inner.read().await.coding_cli.enabled_providers.clone()
  }
  ```
  (Adjust the field path to `ServerSettings`' actual field names for `codingCli.enabledProviders` — verify in `crates/freshell-server/src/settings.rs`.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Run**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-sessions && cargo test -p freshell-server && cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
Expected: ALL PASS, clean. (Every test `SessionSource` impl in the workspace compiles unchanged thanks to the defaulted trait method.)

### Task 6: Hardened wire response + route merge + production fallback wiring (degraded-path proof)

Upgrade `POST /api/sessions/resolve` to the full hardened wire shape and route semantics (`sessions-router.ts:255-316`), wire the production fallbacks to REPORT failures instead of swallowing them, and prove the degraded path on the wire. Includes the async-hygiene verification (context §5).

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs` (wire struct, route merge, tests)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` (state wiring: home_dir from the OS user home, ALWAYS-wired failure-reporting fallback closures — settings do not gate fallbacks)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/claude_snapshot.rs` + `lib.rs` (add `locate_transcript_checked`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 3's `ResumeResolveOutcome`/`ProviderFailure`, Task 4's `opencode_session_row_by_id`, Task 5's `scan_failures()`/`request_refresh()`/`coding_cli_enabled_providers()`.
- Produces: the final wire response `{status, matches, hint, providerErrors, unsearchedProviders, homeDir}`; `freshell_freshagent::locate_transcript_checked(projects_roots: &[PathBuf], session_id: &str) -> Result<Option<PathBuf>, std::io::Error>` (roots supplied by the caller — see Step 3).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing endpoint tests (in `resolve.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)]`)**

Add these; also UPDATE the existing full-body asserts (`warming_with_hint_when_index_never_published`, `exact_match_returns_full_metadata_via_the_index`, fallback tests) to the new shape — every 200 body now carries `providerErrors` (array, default empty), `unsearchedProviders` (array), and `homeDir` (present when the state carries one). To keep expectations deterministic, extend the test `state()` helper: construct `SettingsStore::load(Some(dir), vec!["claude".into(), "codex".into(), "opencode".into(), "amplifier".into()])` and set `home_dir: Some(Arc::new("/home/tester".to_string()))`. Baseline `unsearchedProviders` is `[]`: Task 5 aligned the fresh-store default to Node's four-provider `DEFAULT_ENABLED_CLI_PROVIDERS` (and its settings test asserts exactly that), so with all four enabled nothing is unsearched — assert `body["unsearchedProviders"] == serde_json::json!([])` explicitly in the first new test so a regression fails loudly.

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn wire_shape_carries_the_hardened_provider_health_fields() {
    let dir = temp_dir("wire");
    let index = fixture_index(vec![claude_fixture()]).await;
    let (status, body) = post(state(&dir, Some(index)), serde_json::json!({ "input": CLAUDE_ID }), true).await;
    assert_eq!(status, StatusCode::OK);
    assert_eq!(body["status"], "ready");
    assert_eq!(body["providerErrors"], serde_json::json!([]));
    assert!(body["unsearchedProviders"].is_array());
    assert_eq!(body["homeDir"], "/home/tester");
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn broken_opencode_store_degrades_with_a_provider_error_never_silent_not_found() {
    // THE acceptance test (context §4): an unreadable provider store yields
    // degraded + providerErrors on the wire — matches stay empty, status is
    // NOT "ready".
    let dir = temp_dir("degraded");
    let index = fixture_index(vec![claude_fixture()]).await;
    let mut st = state(&dir, Some(index));

For the five commented tests (`a_provider_scan_failure_reports_degraded_with_the_scan_failed_literal`, `disabled_providers_are_reported_unsearched_never_as_errors`, `disabled_provider_indexed_sessions_do_not_resolve`, `a_disabled_provider_exact_id_still_resolves_via_fallback_node_parity`, `degraded_response_schedules_a_refresh_and_retry_converges`), write the bodies fully in the same style as the snippets above — the `FailingDirectSource` is the Task-5 `FlakySource` test source (keep its toggleable `AtomicBool` so the refresh-convergence test can flip it to recovered; the tests that only need a fixed failure just leave it broken), and the settings file seeding writes `dir/.freshell/config.json` containing the WRAPPED document `{"version":1,"settings":{"codingCli":{"enabledProviders":["claude"]}}}` (`SettingsStore` reads `<home>/.freshell/config.json` and unwraps the top-level `settings` key — see `load_full_settings` in `settings_store.rs`; there is NO `settings.json` and a bare `codingCli` object would be ignored, silently reading defaults).

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-server` — expected FAIL/compile-error (new state fields, wire fields missing).

> **POST-EXECUTION NOTE (2026-07-31):** historical RED gate — the failure
> occurred as expected during execution, and Steps 2–3's implementation then
> landed (commit `1480e2a71`). It is NOT reproducible at HEAD: the state and
> wire fields all exist now, and `cargo test -p freshell-server` passes.

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement the wire + route merge in `resolve.rs`**

- Extend `ResolveState`:
  ```rust
  pub home_dir: Option<Arc<String>>,
  ```
- Replace the Task-3 `LegacyWire` with the final wire struct (field order = the Node route's object literal, `sessions-router.ts:306-314`):
  ```rust
  /// Wire response (`ResumeResolveResponseSchema`): the core outcome plus the
  /// router-level provider-health fields. `providerErrors`/`unsearchedProviders`
  /// are always present (zod defaults exist for legacy tolerance, but Node
  /// always sends them); `homeDir` is omitted only when the server has no
  /// resolvable home.
  #[derive(serde::Serialize)]
  #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
  struct ResolveWireResponse {
      status: ResumeResolveStatus,
      matches: Vec<ResumeResolveMatch>,
      hint: Option<ResumeHint>,
      provider_errors: Vec<ResumeResolveProviderError>,
      unsearched_providers: Vec<String>,
      #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
      home_dir: Option<String>,
  }
  ```
- After the `spawn_blocking` join: a `JoinError` means the resolver PANICKED — return `500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` with a JSON error body (the router's standard error shape), NOT a fabricated ready-empty result. The hardened contract forbids presenting an unsearchable state as a healthy "not found"; masking a crashed locator/query as ready-empty is exactly the incident class this plan closes. RECORDED DEVIATION (state it in the module doc): Node has no defined behavior here — a top-level resolver throw becomes an unhandled rejection in the async Express 4 handler (no response at all), so the explicit 500 is the honest port, not a wire mismatch. Update the pre-existing panic-fallback test (it currently pins ready-empty-on-JoinError) to assert the 500. Then, on the `Ok(outcome)` path, merge exactly like the Node route:
  ```rust
  /// `KNOWN_RESUME_PROVIDERS` = `DEFAULT_ENABLED_CLI_PROVIDERS`
  /// (`shared/coding-cli-defaults.ts:3`).
  const KNOWN_RESUME_PROVIDERS: [&str; 4] = ["claude", "codex", "opencode", "amplifier"];

  // Read the enabled set BEFORE dispatching the core resolve, and FILTER the
  // snapshot with it: Node's index EXCLUDES disabled providers at scan time
  // (session-indexer.ts:1454-1467), so its resolution never sees their
  // sessions (resolve-session.ts:85). The Rust SessionIndex is built with all
  // four sources unconditionally, so the route must apply the equivalent gate
  // — otherwise a disabled provider's indexed session resolves while the same
  // response lists that provider under unsearchedProviders. Fallbacks stay
  // UNGATED (Node invokes all wired exact-id fallbacks regardless of
  // settings — resolve-session.ts:127-156).
  let enabled: std::collections::HashSet<String> =
      state.settings.coding_cli_enabled_providers().await.into_iter().collect();
  // ... before the spawn_blocking call: if the snapshot is Some(sessions),
  // retain only sessions whose provider is in `enabled` (warming stays None);
  // pass the FILTERED list into resolve_resume_input ...
  let unsearched_providers: Vec<String> = KNOWN_RESUME_PROVIDERS
      .iter()
      .filter(|name| !enabled.contains(**name))
      .map(|name| (*name).to_string())
      .collect();
  // Scan failures: enabled-only, fallback errors win the dedupe (more
  // specific code/message). Disabled+failed must NOT stick degraded forever.
  let mut provider_errors = outcome.provider_errors;
  if let Some(index) = state.session_index.as_ref() {
      for name in index.scan_failures() {
          if !enabled.contains(&name) || provider_errors.iter().any(|e| e.provider == name) {
              continue;
          }
          provider_errors.push(ResumeResolveProviderError {
              provider: name,
              code: None,
              message: Some("session scan failed".to_string()),
          });
      }
  }
  let status = match outcome.status {
      ResumeResolveStatus::Warming => ResumeResolveStatus::Warming,
      _ if !provider_errors.is_empty() => ResumeResolveStatus::Degraded,
      _ => ResumeResolveStatus::Ready,
  };
  if status == ResumeResolveStatus::Degraded {
      if let Some(index) = state.session_index.as_ref() {
          index.request_refresh();
      }
  }
  Json(ResolveWireResponse {
      status,
      matches: outcome.matches,
      hint: outcome.hint,
      provider_errors,
      unsearched_providers,
      home_dir: state.home_dir.as_ref().map(|h| h.as_str().to_string()),
  })
  .into_response()
  ```
- Update the module doc's behavior-contract bullet list with the new fields and the degraded semantics (one bullet each).

- [ ] **Step 3: Failure-reporting production closures + checked claude locator**

3a. `crates/freshell-freshagent/src/claude_snapshot.rs` — add alongside `locate_transcript` (which stays, other consumers depend on it):

```rust
/// Error-AWARE variant of [`locate_transcript`] for the resolve endpoint's
/// provider-health channel (#586 parity): an unreadable claude store must
/// surface as a provider error, never a silent miss. A missing projects dir
/// (`NotFound`) is a genuine miss for that root; any OTHER io error
/// propagates.
///
/// The projects roots are a PARAMETER, exactly like Node's locator takes
/// `projectsDir` (`claude-transcript-locator.ts:65-67`) — the CALLER resolves
/// the environment. Do NOT resolve roots via `claude_home_candidates()`
/// here: that helper adds `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and bare-`CLAUDE_HOME` roots
/// that Node's resolver (`getSessionRoots()` = `getClaudeHome()/projects`,
/// `providers/claude.ts:524-535`, `server/claude-home.ts:4-7`) and the Rust
/// session index intentionally exclude — with an explicit `CLAUDE_HOME`
/// override it would expose transcripts from a root Node never searches.
/// Parameterizing the roots also keeps the unit tests hermetic: they pass
/// temp dirs and never mutate process-global env.
///
/// Traversal order is Node's GLOBAL two-pass order
/// (`claude-transcript-locator.ts:69-88`): PASS 1 probes the DIRECT layout
/// across ALL roots, then PASS 2 probes the subagent layout across all roots
/// — NOT per-root direct+subagent. (With roots `[A, B]`: A direct, B direct,
/// A subagent, B subagent.)
pub fn locate_transcript_checked(
    projects_roots: &[PathBuf],
    session_id: &str,
) -> Result<Option<PathBuf>, std::io::Error> {
    // PASS 1 — direct layout across all roots.
    for projects in projects_roots {
        if let Some(path) = find_transcript_checked_direct(projects, session_id)? {
            return Ok(Some(path));
        }
    }
    // PASS 2 — subagent layout, only when the direct layout missed everywhere.
    for projects in projects_roots {
        if let Some(path) = find_transcript_checked_subagent(projects, session_id)? {
            return Ok(Some(path));
        }
    }
    Ok(None)
}
```

and `find_transcript_checked_direct` / `find_transcript_checked_subagent` helpers (one per Node layout pass) that are `find_transcript` with error propagation: same id-shape guard (returns `Ok(None)`), then

```rust
/// Node parity (`claude-transcript-locator.ts:33-37`): expected absence is
/// `ENOENT || ENOTDIR` — a missing dir OR a non-directory path component is
/// a genuine miss; everything else is a provider failure.
fn is_expected_absence(e: &std::io::Error) -> bool {
    matches!(
        e.kind(),
        std::io::ErrorKind::NotFound | std::io::ErrorKind::NotADirectory
    )
}

let entries = match std::fs::read_dir(&projects) {
    Ok(entries) => entries,
    Err(e) if is_expected_absence(&e) => return Ok(None),
    Err(e) => return Err(e),
};
```

and the scan must construct the AUTHORITATIVE Node candidate layouts (`server/coding-cli/claude-transcript-locator.ts:39-48`): the direct helper probes `<projects>/<project-dir>/<id>.jsonl`, the subagent helper probes `<projects>/<project-dir>/<parent-session>/subagents/<id>.jsonl` — and the caller runs the direct pass across ALL roots before ANY subagent probing (Node's global two-pass order above). CAUTION: the existing `find_transcript` probes `<project-dir>/<subdir>/<id>.jsonl` WITHOUT the `subagents` segment — that diverges from Node and misses child sessions; do NOT mirror it. The checked variant uses the Node layout (leave `find_transcript` itself untouched for its other consumers). Propagate errors that are not expected-absence (`is_expected_absence` above — NotFound OR NotADirectory, Node's `ENOENT || ENOTDIR`) from every `read_dir`, and probe candidate files with `std::fs::metadata` (expected absence ⇒ miss for that candidate; any OTHER error propagates) instead of the error-swallowing `Path::is_file()`.

Also add `transcript_cwd_checked(path: &Path) -> Result<Option<String>, std::io::Error>` beside `transcript_cwd` (which stays for other consumers): open error of expected-absence kind ⇒ `Ok(None)` (a raced deletion keeps the hit, cwd-less — Node behaves the same); any OTHER open/read error PROPAGATES (Node wraps these in `ClaudeTranscriptLocatorError`); malformed JSON lines are still skipped. BOUNDED READ (Node parity — `CWD_SCAN_BYTES = 64 * 1024`, `claude-transcript-locator.ts:30-31,131-135`): read AT MOST the first 64 KiB of the file (e.g. `std::io::Read::take(64 * 1024)` into a buffer), split that prefix on `\n`, and attempt to parse EVERY segment INCLUDING the final one — Node's `head.split('\n')` loop (`claude-transcript-locator.ts:141-149`) has no discard-the-truncated-tail rule: a fragment cut off at the 64 KiB boundary simply fails `JSON.parse` and is skipped by the `catch`, while a COMPLETE final line with no trailing newline (e.g. the last line of a small transcript) still parses. Do NOT drop the final segment. Parse each segment as JSON and return the first non-empty string `cwd`. Do NOT mirror the existing `transcript_cwd`'s unbounded `BufRead::lines()` loop — one resolve request against a multi-GB transcript (or a single enormous line) must not allocate or scan past the 64 KiB prefix. The 3b wiring below uses the checked variant — without it the "no longer swallowed" commit claim would be false, since `transcript_cwd` converts read errors to `None`.

Re-export `locate_transcript_checked` and `transcript_cwd_checked` from `lib.rs` next to `locate_transcript`. Unit tests in the same file's test module — HERMETIC BY CONSTRUCTION: every test builds a temp projects dir and passes it via the `projects_roots` parameter; NO test mutates process-global env (`CLAUDE_HOME`/`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`/`HOME`), so there is nothing to race against the crate's many existing env-mutating claude tests. (If a future test ever DOES need env mutation, it must hold the crate's shared `CLAUDE_ENV_LOCK` (`claude.rs`) and use the panic-safe `EnvVarsRestore` Drop-guard pattern (`claude_snapshot.rs:531-569`) — but none of the tests below need it.) The tests: (a) gate the permission test with `#[cfg(unix)]` (`std::os::unix::fs::PermissionsExt` does not exist on Windows — an ungated test would not COMPILE there): chmod the projects dir to `0o000`, then FIRST probe `std::fs::read_dir(&projects)` directly — if the probe unexpectedly SUCCEEDS (running as root / CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE bypasses mode bits), restore permissions, `eprintln!("skipping: euid bypasses permission checks");` and `return`; otherwise assert `locate_transcript_checked` yields `Err` with `kind() == PermissionDenied`; restore permissions afterward so cleanup works; (b) a missing projects dir yields `Ok(None)`; (c) a transcript placed at `<projects>/<project>/<parent>/subagents/<id>.jsonl` IS found by `locate_transcript_checked` (the child-session layout); (d) ENOTDIR absence parity: a candidate path whose component is a REGULAR FILE (e.g. `<projects>/<project>` created as a file, so descending into it fails with `NotADirectory`) yields `Ok(None)`, not `Err` — Node reports a normal miss for `ENOTDIR` (`claude-transcript-locator.ts:33-37`); (e) bounded cwd scan: a transcript whose only `cwd`-bearing JSON line starts BEYOND the first 64 KiB (pad with ~65 KiB of valid no-cwd JSONL first) makes `transcript_cwd_checked` return `Ok(None)` — proving the 64 KiB prefix bound, Node parity; (f) two-pass precedence: the SAME id present at BOTH the direct layout in one root AND the subagent layout — with a single root, and again with two roots where root A holds only the subagent copy and root B holds the direct copy — `locate_transcript_checked` returns the DIRECT path (B's direct copy beats A's subagent copy: pass 1 exhausts ALL roots first, Node's global order); (g) final-fragment parse parity: a transcript SMALLER than 64 KiB whose ONLY `cwd`-bearing JSON line is the LAST line and has NO trailing newline → `transcript_cwd_checked` returns `Ok(Some(cwd))` (Node's `split('\n')` parses the final segment); (h) truncated-tail tolerance: a JSON object that STRADDLES the 64 KiB boundary (starts inside the prefix, ends beyond it) is skipped without error — `Ok(None)` when no earlier line carries a cwd.

3b. `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` — final wiring (replaces the Task-3/4 temporaries). Above the router construction:

```rust
// Resolve fallbacks mirror Node's buildResolveFallbacks over the FIXED
// provider registry (server/index.ts wires ALL FOUR codingCliProviders into
// it unconditionally): settings do NOT gate the exact-id fallbacks — they
// only gate INDEXING and feed unsearchedProviders. Both closures are
// therefore ALWAYS wired; gating them on boot-time settings would produce
// false misses after a live settings change and diverge from Node for
// disabled-provider exact IDs.

/// Wire error code for a provider-error summary. Node preserves the ORIGINAL
/// `cause.code` VERBATIM (`ClaudeTranscriptLocatorError`,
/// `claude-transcript-locator.ts:19-27`): EPERM stays EPERM, EIO stays EIO.
/// So derive the symbolic errno name from the RAW OS errno — do NOT map from
/// `ErrorKind`, which would collapse EPERM into EACCES and drop EIO/EMFILE
/// entirely. `libc` is already a freshell-server dependency
/// (`crates/freshell-server/Cargo.toml`).

> **POST-EXECUTION NOTE (2026-07-31):** the wiring above landed with the closure
> bodies extracted to named helpers in `crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` —
> `resolve_wire_home_dir()` (the `homeDir` field) and
> `resolve_claude_exact_id_fallback()` (the `locate_claude_transcript` body) —

Home-resolution verifiers for this wiring (landed, in `main.rs`'s test module and `session_directory.rs`'s test module):
- `claude_exact_id_fallback_finds_transcript_in_a_userprofile_only_environment` (`crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs`) — the USERPROFILE-only exact-id fallback test: HOME and CLAUDE_HOME unset, USERPROFILE pointing at a temp home containing `.claude/projects/<project>/<id>.jsonl`; the fallback ITSELF (not just `provider_home()`) must return the transcript hit with the lowercased id and its cwd.
- `wire_home_dir_treats_empty_home_as_unset_falling_back_to_userprofile` (`crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs`) — an EMPTY `HOME` must fall through to `USERPROFILE` for the `homeDir` wire field.
- `provider_home_falls_back_to_userprofile_when_home_unset`, `provider_home_prefers_home_over_userprofile`, `provider_home_none_when_home_and_userprofile_unset` (`crates/freshell-server/src/session_directory.rs`) — the shared helper's precedence and empty-as-unset semantics.

- [ ] **Step 4: Async-hygiene verification (context §5 — verify, don't assume)**

Confirm and record (in the commit message body): the ENTIRE `resolve_resume_input` call — including both blocking fallback closures (rusqlite query, transcript directory walk) — runs inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` (`resolve.rs`, the Task-3-preserved block), so no DB/FS wait ever blocks the async runtime; per-request work is bounded by `MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES (8) × FALLBACK_BUDGET_PER_REQUEST (2 per provider)` fallback calls + one index scan per token. Grep that no OTHER call path invokes these closures outside `spawn_blocking`: `grep -rn "opencode_session_by_id\|locate_claude_transcript" crates/freshell-server/src/ --include=*.rs`. Add one sentence to `resolve.rs`'s module doc stating this invariant so future edits keep it.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run**

Run:
```bash
set -o pipefail
cargo test -p freshell-server && cargo test -p freshell-freshagent
cargo test --workspace 2>&1 | grep -E '^test result:'
cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
Expected: ALL PASS (every `test result:` line shows `0 failed`), fmt/clippy clean. (`set -o pipefail` keeps a failing `cargo test` from exiting through `grep`'s success status.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs crates/freshell-freshagent/src/
git commit -m "feat(server): hardened resolve wire — providerErrors/unsearchedProviders/homeDir, scan-failure merge, degraded fire-and-forget refresh

by-id) instead of swallowing them; degraded-path proven on the wire

### Task 7: Full verification, shared e2e 2× both projects, SYNC-06 checklist evidence, push

The `sessionResolve` flag and the shared client dialog's resume HAPPY PATH are proven by the SHARED e2e spec running against BOTH server kinds. Scope honesty: `resume-button.spec.ts` has exactly 3 tests (pinned-button visibility at scroll positions, mobile visibility, paste-then-Enter exact resume) — it does NOT exercise degraded UI, manual retry, or homeDir prefill. Those hardened behaviors are proven at the WIRE level by Task 6's endpoint tests, and by the shared client's own #586 coverage (unchanged by this branch, but EXECUTED here — Step 2 runs `test:client`, which includes `ResumeSessionDialog.test.tsx`'s degraded/retry/homeDir/unsearched tests, and the shared contract test). Then record the evidence and push.

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/plans/2026-07-14-rust-tauri-parity-completion-checklist.md` (SYNC-06 entry, line ~803)
- No source changes expected; any failure discovered here is fixed by amending the responsible earlier area with its own test-first micro-cycle.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: all previous tasks' work, committed.
- Produces: green full-matrix evidence + updated checklist + pushed branch.

- [ ] **Step 1: Rust full gate**

Run:
```bash
set -o pipefail
cargo test --workspace 2>&1 | grep -E '^test result:'
cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
Expected: every `test result:` line shows `0 failed`; fmt/clippy clean. (`set -o pipefail` keeps a failing `cargo test` from exiting through the pipe with `grep`'s success status.) Cargo prints one `test result:` line PER TEST BINARY and no workspace aggregate — record the checklist's total passed count by SUMMING the `N passed` figures across the printed lines.

- [ ] **Step 2: Coordinated TS suites**

Run:
```bash
npm run test:status
npm run test:vitest -- --config config/vitest/vitest.config.ts test/unit/shared/resume-input-parser.test.ts test/unit/shared/resume-resolve-contract.test.ts --run
npm run test:vitest -- --config config/vitest/vitest.server.config.ts test/unit/server/coding-cli/resolve-session.test.ts test/unit/server/coding-cli/resolve-fallbacks.test.ts test/integration/server/sessions-resolve-router.test.ts --run
npm run test:client
```
Expected: ALL PASS (the branch did not modify Node server or client code; these prove no accidental TS regressions). The last two runs are VERIFICATION EVIDENCE for the hardened UI claims, not optional: `resume-resolve-contract.test.ts` proves the shared wire contract (degraded/providerErrors/unsearchedProviders/homeDir/legacy tolerance) the Rust server now emits, and `test:client` (the coordinator's `test/unit/client` suite) EXECUTES `ResumeSessionDialog.test.tsx` — warming/manual retry, degraded display + no auto-resume, homeDir prefill, unsearched-provider messaging. Citing those tests without running them is not evidence. If `test:status` reports another session's run in progress, WAIT — never kill processes you did not spawn.

- [ ] **Step 3: Shared e2e, both projects, twice**

Sanity-check first that the flag declaration still stands: `grep -n "sessionResolve" crates/freshell-server/src/main.rs` — expected: present in `build_platform_payload`.

Run TWICE (the config's own server management uses ephemeral ports/HOMEs — verify no `--port 3001/3002` style overrides leak in via env before running). The explicit `--project` filters are REQUIRED: without them the default `chromium` project also matches this spec and each run would be 9 tests, not 6:
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- resume-button.spec.ts --project=legacy-chromium --project=rust-chromium
npm run test:e2e -- resume-button.spec.ts --project=legacy-chromium --project=rust-chromium
```
Expected: all 3 tests × both projects (legacy-chromium AND rust-chromium) pass, both runs — 6/6 each run. This is the acceptance proof that the shared dialog's resume happy path (paste-then-Enter exact resume) and the `sessionResolve` flag work identically against the Rust server; the hardened degraded/retry/homeDir behaviors are proven at the wire level by Task 6's endpoint tests (this spec does not exercise them).

- [ ] **Step 4: Update the SYNC-06 checklist entry (PARTIAL convention)**

In `docs/plans/2026-07-14-rust-tauri-parity-completion-checklist.md`, append a NEW `PARTIAL` bullet under the SYNC-06 item, directly after the existing `PARTIAL (2026-07-30, commit c38422a0)` bullet, following that bullet's exact style:

> **POST-EXECUTION NOTE (2026-07-31):** the `c38422a0` reference above is a
> PRE-REWORD SHA that no longer exists in this branch's history (the branch
> was reworded in place; commit `6976f1caf` remapped the checklist's SHAs).
> The bullet it points at now reads `PARTIAL / REOPENED (2026-07-30)` with no
> commit reference, and the new bullet this step appends landed in the
> checklist citing the reworded implementation commit `22022a848`.

```markdown
  - PARTIAL (2026-07-30, hardened-contract follow-up, commit `<HEAD short sha>`): rebased onto `f903e8a6` (#586) and closed the hardening delta. Contract: `status` gains `degraded`; `providerErrors`/`unsearchedProviders`/`homeDir` on the wire (`crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs`). Ranking: per-token exact→fallback→prefix, ses_ case-SENSITIVE, subagents excluded from prefix discovery, sessionType provider-default. Parser: known-family prefix regex + MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES=8, pinned by the EXTENDED shared fixture `test/fixtures/resume-input/parser-cases.json` (<N> cases; TS test restored to fixture-driven form) green on BOTH parsers. Provider health: broken opencode store → degraded + providerErrors on the wire (never silent not-found), scan-failure channel + disabled→unsearched, degraded fire-and-forget refresh; hardened by-id row query (archived+child, errors propagate). Async hygiene: all fallback IO inside spawn_blocking, work bounded by cap-8×budget-2. `cargo test --workspace`: <N> passed, 0 failed; fmt+clippy clean. E2E: `resume-button.spec.ts` green on BOTH projects, 2 runs each (<N>/<N> per run). MISSING: the `PW-TAURI-WIN` (native Windows WebView2) half remains out of scope, per the SYNC-05/SAFE-11 PARTIAL convention.
```

Replace every `<N>`/`<HEAD short sha>` with the REAL numbers/sha from Steps 1–3 (they are evidence, not boilerplate — copy them from the actual command output).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit and push (NO PR)**

```bash
git add docs/plans/2026-07-14-rust-tauri-parity-completion-checklist.md
git commit -m "docs: record SYNC-06 hardened-contract parity evidence in completion checklist

## Self-Review Record

**1. Spec coverage** (context §"The delta to close" → tasks): §1 CONTRACT (degraded/providerErrors/unsearchedProviders/homeDir, camelCase, backward-tolerant) → Tasks 3+6. §2 RANKING (per-token exact→fallback→prefix, ses_ case-sensitive, subagents, sessionType default) → Task 3. §3 PARSER (known-family regex, cap-8, fixture extended, both sides pass) → Task 2. §4 PROVIDER HEALTH (degraded never-silent, disabled→unsearched, degraded-even-with-matches, match-cap verified: hardened Node keeps `RESOLVE_MATCH_CAP = 20`, so the branch's cap-20 pin stands) → Tasks 3+5+6. §5 ASYNC HYGIENE → Task 6 Step 4. §6 WARMING (core + wire tests, Tasks 3+6) + shared dialog happy-path via shared e2e → Task 7 (degraded/retry/homeDir UI proven at the wire by Task 6 AND by the EXECUTED shared client suite — Task 7 Step 2 runs `test:client`, which includes `ResumeSessionDialog.test.tsx`, plus the shared contract test; the e2e spec covers visibility + exact resume only). Acceptance items: rebase done (verified Task 1), fixture both-sides (Task 2), mirror suite updated (Task 3), degraded-path wire test (Task 6), e2e 2× both (Task 7), cargo+TS green (Tasks 1–7), SYNC-06 PARTIAL update (Task 7), branch pushed / no PR (Task 7). No unresolved coverage gaps.

**1b. No silent deferrals:** Injected-closure tests in Tasks 3/6 are complemented by production-behavior proof: Task 4 tests hit REAL sqlite files (corrupt/missing/locked classes, with the SQLITE_* codes asserted on the INTERNAL `OpencodeByIdError` — the wire deliberately carries message-only opencode errors, matching Node's worker boundary which strips `.code` in production (`opencode-by-id.worker.ts:41-42`, `opencode-by-id-runner.ts:103-106`); the endpoint test asserts the code-ABSENT wire shape and the internal code feeds structured logs), Task 6 Step 3 wires the REAL closures with failure reporting and tests the checked locator against a real unreadable directory, and Task 7's shared e2e exercises the full production path against the real Rust server. The one intentionally-remaining gap (PW-TAURI-WIN) is the checklist's long-standing recorded convention, explicitly restated — not a new deferral introduced by this plan.

**2. Placeholder scan (CORRECTED 2026-07-31):** the original self-review understated this: Task 4 Step 1 shipped TEN comment-only test bodies and Task 6 Step 1 shipped FIVE — fifteen syntactically valid tests whose bodies were only comments, i.e. unresolved placeholders that would have PASSED VACUOUSLY if pasted as-is (an independent review flagged this, and flagged that this line falsely declared no placeholders remained). Each did name the fixture pattern, exact inputs, and expected JSON/values, but the blocks themselves were not enforcing verifiers. Both blocks now carry `unimplemented!()` markers (a literal paste fails loudly) plus post-execution notes pointing at the real verifiers, which landed with full assertions in `crates/freshell-sessions/tests/opencode_row_by_id.rs` and the test module of `crates/freshell-server/src/resolve.rs` under the same test names. Checklist `<N>` slots are run-time evidence by design.

**3. Type consistency check:** `ResumeResolveOutcome{status,matches,hint,provider_errors}` produced in Task 3 = consumed in Task 6. `OpencodeByIdHit{session_id,cwd,title,last_activity_at}` (Task 3) is built from `OpencodeByIdRow` (Task 4) in Task 6's closure — field names verified 1:1. `ProviderFailure{code,message}` used identically in Tasks 3/4/6. `scan_failures()->Vec<String>`, `request_refresh()`, `async coding_cli_enabled_providers()->Vec<String>` (Task 5) match Task 6's call sites (awaited in the async route/main). `MAX_RESUME_CANDIDATES` (Task 2) referenced in Task 6's hygiene note. State field `opencode_session_by_id` renamed once in Task 3 and used consistently after.
