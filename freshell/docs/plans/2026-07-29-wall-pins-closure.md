**Goal:** Close the three remaining `test.fail` pins in the restart contract wall (`test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts`) so the wall finishes green with ZERO expected-fail pins, stably (3 consecutive full runs).

**Architecture:** Three product fixes to the restart-resilience machinery. Pin 1 (claude never-conversed → Respawn, not DeadSession) and Pin 3 (pending-marker read → loud `fresh_by_race` verdict + DOM-visible breadcrumb) both modify `derive_verdicts` in `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs` — adjacent match arms, sequenced in that order. Pin 2 (claude identity durable BEFORE the PTY spawn makes it observable in argv, plus a wrong e2e probe selector) is a disjoint subsystem and lands last. All three pins were root-caused by a systematic-debugging investigation; each task re-verifies its load-bearing diagnostic claim before building on it.

**Tech Stack:** Rust (axum/tokio server in `crates/`), TypeScript/React client (`src/`), Playwright e2e (`test/e2e-browser/`), Vitest unit tests (`test/unit/`).

## Global Constraints

- **Worktree:** all work happens in `/home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/wall-pins-closure` on branch `fix/wall-pins-closure`, based on `origin/main` at `c1c67464` (already fetched and current — verify with `git log --oneline -1 origin/main` before Task 1; if origin/main moved, rebase first: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`).
- **Ports:** NEVER use ports 3001 or 3002 (the user's LIVE server runs on 3002). The e2e harness picks kernel-ephemeral ports automatically (`findFreePort()` binds port 0) — never override with a fixed port, never set `PORT`.
- **NEVER restart the user's live server.** NEVER use broad kill patterns (`pkill`, `killall`, `kill` by name). Tests kill only PIDs they own.
- **Shared host:** no synthetic load, no parallel wall runs.
- **Node test coordinator gate:** before any `npm test`, run `npm run test:status`; if the gate is held, WAIT and retry (poll every 60s) — do not force. Full runs use: `FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY='wall pins closure' env -u FRESHELL_BIND_HOST npm test`.
- **TDD:** Red-Green-Refactor for every step. Frequent, focused, atomic commits.
- **Wall flip protocol** (spec header, `restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts:12-16`): Playwright turns an unexpected PASS of a `test.fail()` test into a hard failure — that is the signal to DELETE the `test.fail()` lines and let the assertion run green. Never widen a pin; never convert a pin to `test.fixme`. **If a pin cannot honestly flip, STOP and report the failing evidence — never re-pin.**
- **Contract:** the verdict `reason` field is a free-form `Option<String>` / `z.string().optional()` — NOT enum-pinned. Adding `"fresh_by_race"` requires zero schema regeneration, but the gates still verify: `npm run contract:generate` must produce no diff, `npm run test:port` green, `cargo test -p freshell-protocol --locked` green.
- **Docs:** README.md is the only end-user markdown doc; this plan (under `docs/plans/`) is a working/agent doc. Create no other markdown files.
- **PR policy: do NOT create a PR.** Push the branch (`git push -u origin fix/wall-pins-closure`) and stop. Landing happens outside this workflow.
- **Rust gates (every task that touches Rust):** `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
- **E2e invocation:** `npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium <spec> [-g "<title>"]` — `--project=rust-chromium` is mandatory (the wall is in `RUST_ONLY_SPECS`). The harness lazily builds `target/release/freshell-server`; pre-build with `cargo build --release -p freshell-server` to keep test timing honest.

## Scope note

The three pins are one deliverable — "the wall finishes green with zero pins" — with a load-bearing fix order (Pin 1 → Pin 3 share `derive_verdicts`; Pin 2 is disjoint). They ship as one plan on one branch; each task is independently red-green testable.

## Background: the three pins (current state, verified against `c1c67464`)

| Pin | Wall leg (title / `test.fail` line) | Root cause (verified by exploration) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `THE RULER: all pane types live, one SIGKILL, every §2 contract holds` (`:1459`, pin at `:1500-1503`) — red leg: the claude `--resume <preallocatedId>` argv poll at `:1752-1760` | `derive_verdicts` Absent arm (`reconcile.rs:316-360`) has an amplifier carve-out (`:327`) but none for claude. A claude pane created (id preallocated, ledger binding durable → `ever_observed` true via `ledger.ever_bound`) but never conversed with has no transcript file → `Absent` → `DeadSession{session_not_on_disk}` (`:349-353`). PR #565's locator fallback (`crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs:156-170`) only rescues *exists-but-unparseable* files; a never-created file is genuinely `Absent`. |
| 3 | `SIGKILL-inside-locator-window: never silently fresh` (`:1933`, pin at `:1949-1952`) | Write side complete: `record_pending` at `terminal.rs:2449-2462` for `MARKER_MODES=["codex","opencode","amplifier"]` (`:105`), keyed by `terminal_id`, surviving SIGKILL (exit-hook delete at `:1338` doesn't run on SIGKILL). Read side MISSING: zero production readers of pending markers; the no-identity path emits `Fresh{no_recoverable_identity}` (`reconcile.rs:292-295`) and the client renders `"Started fresh (no_recoverable_identity)."` into the **xterm canvas** (`TerminalView.tsx:4326` via `writeLocalXtermNotice`) — invisible to the leg's DOM probe `getByText(/couldn't be resumed|could not be resumed|fresh session/i)`. **Correction to the task brief:** roadmap P1.10 (re-arm the opencode locator on restore-created panes) IS ALREADY LANDED — `maybe_arm` is called unconditionally at `terminal.rs:2319`, `OpencodeLocator::arm` gates only on missing identity, pinned by `#[tokio::test] restore_created_pane_without_identity_arms_and_resolves_into_the_ledger` (`crates/freshell-ws/src/opencode_association.rs:536`). Task 5 verifies this instead of rebuilding it. |
| 2 | `SIGKILL-within-5s-of-pane-creation: identity survives without client state` (`:1816`, pin at `:1825-1828`) | Boot-time recovery IS wired (candidate cause (a) is FALSE): `RecoveryOfferPanel` mounts unconditionally (`App.tsx:1926`), fetches `GET /api/recovery/inventory` on mount when `!hadPersistedLayoutAtBoot || pendingOffer` (`RecoveryOfferPanel.tsx:83`) — proven green by `recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts` scenarios 1–3. Two real gaps: **Gap A (race, candidate cause (b))** — claude is excluded from `MARKER_MODES` and its binding row is written 7 `.await` points (~230 lines) AFTER the PTY spawn (`spawn .await :2211` vs `record_binding .await :2445`) while the fake CLI's argv line appears synchronously at spawn — the leg kills right after argv, potentially before durability. **Gap B (test)** — the leg's probe `getByText(/recover .*pane/i)` (`:1920`) can never match the panel's actual heading `Restore N panes from server memory?` (`RecoveryOfferPanel.tsx:217`); the stable handle is `data-testid="recovery-offer-panel"`. Task 6 instruments to confirm Gap A empirically, then fixes both. |

Full investigation reports (background only; the plan is self-contained): `/home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/.the-usual-logs/wall-pins-closure/reports/{pin1-claude-verdict,pin3-pending-markers,pin2-recovery-offer,wall-and-gates,snippets-for-plan}.md`.

### Task 1: Probe API split — `ever_observed_on_disk`

Pin 1 needs to distinguish two facts that today's `ever_observed` conflates: "the transcript was actually SEEN on disk" (in-process observed set, fed by index snapshots and the PR #565 locator fallback) vs "the identity was ever ledger-bound" (durable, survives restarts, but proves only that the id was minted — a never-conversed claude session is ledger-bound yet has never had a transcript). This task adds `ever_observed_on_disk` to the probe trait without changing any existing behavior.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/existence.rs` (the `SessionExistenceProbe` trait — currently exactly two methods, `exists` and `ever_observed`, no defaults)
- Modify: `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs` (the `IndexExistenceProbe` impl at lines 110–189; tests in `mod tests` from line 191)
- Test: `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs` (`mod tests`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: existing `SessionExistenceProbe` trait; `IndexExistenceProbe { observed: Mutex<HashSet<String>>, ledger: Option<Arc<PaneLedger>>, ... }`; `PaneLedger::ever_bound(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> bool`.
- Produces: `fn ever_observed_on_disk(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> bool` on the `SessionExistenceProbe` trait, with a default implementation delegating to `ever_observed` (so test fakes whose observed set already means "seen on disk" — like `FakeProbe` in `reconcile.rs` tests — need no override), and an override on `IndexExistenceProbe` that consults ONLY the in-process observed set (never the ledger). Task 2 consumes this.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

In `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs` `mod tests`, next to `ever_observed_survives_a_restart_via_the_ledger` (line ~376 — reuse its exact probe+ledger construction; it builds a probe with a ledger installed and a session that was bound but is not in any index snapshot):

```rust
    /// PIN 1 (claude never-conversed carve-out): "seen on disk" is a strictly
    /// stronger fact than "ever bound". A ledger binding proves the identity
    /// was minted at create — NOT that a transcript ever existed. The
    /// carve-out keys on disk observation, so ever_bound alone must not
    /// count.
    #[test]
    fn ever_observed_on_disk_excludes_ledger_only_bindings() {
        // Construct probe + ledger EXACTLY as
        // ever_observed_survives_a_restart_via_the_ledger does (same fixture
        // helpers, same bound-but-never-on-disk session id), then:
        // assert!(probe.ever_observed("claude", session_id));           // via ledger — unchanged
        // assert!(!probe.ever_observed_on_disk("claude", session_id));  // NEW: ledger does not count
    }
```

Copy the sibling test's body verbatim up to its assertion, then replace/extend the assertions as shown in the comments (the two `assert!` lines are the required assertions; the construction lines come from the sibling). Also add a second test asserting the positive path via the observed set:

```rust
    /// A genuine on-disk observation (index snapshot or locator-fallback hit)
    /// counts for BOTH ever_observed and ever_observed_on_disk.
    #[test]
    fn ever_observed_on_disk_true_after_disk_observation() {
        // Construct probe as zero_turn_claude_transcript_on_disk_is_present_not_absent
        // does (temp claude home + locator + warm index + zero-turn file), call
        // probe.exists("claude", session_id) once (fallback hit feeds the
        // observed set), then:
        // assert!(probe.ever_observed_on_disk("claude", session_id));
    }
```

(That sibling is `#[tokio::test]` at line ~296 — mirror its async-ness and cleanup.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail to compile (RED)**

Run: `cd /home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/wall-pins-closure && cargo test -p freshell-server --lib existence`
Expected: compile error — `no method named ever_observed_on_disk`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the trait method with a default**

In `crates/freshell-ws/src/existence.rs`, inside `trait SessionExistenceProbe`, after `ever_observed`:

```rust
    /// "Seen on disk" strictly: true only if this process actually observed
    /// the session artifact on disk (index snapshots, or the claude
    /// locator-fallback hit). Unlike `ever_observed`, durable ledger bindings
    /// do NOT count — a binding proves the identity was minted, not that a
    /// transcript ever existed (PIN 1: the claude never-conversed carve-out
    /// keys on this distinction). Default: delegate to `ever_observed`, which
    /// is already disk-only for fakes without a ledger.
    fn ever_observed_on_disk(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> bool {
        self.ever_observed(provider, session_id)
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Override on `IndexExistenceProbe`**

In `crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs`, inside `impl SessionExistenceProbe for IndexExistenceProbe` (after the existing `ever_observed` at lines 176–188):

```rust
    fn ever_observed_on_disk(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> bool {
        self.observed
            .lock()
            .expect("observed set lock")
            .contains(&format!("{provider}:{session_id}"))
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run tests to verify they pass (GREEN)**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-server --lib existence`
Expected: PASS, including all pre-existing existence tests (`ever_observed_survives_a_restart_via_the_ledger`, the four kata-09v1 fallback tests) — `ever_observed` itself is untouched.

- [ ] **Step 6: Rust gates**

Run: `cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
Expected: clean. (If `fmt` complains, run `cargo fmt --all` and re-check.)

- [ ] **Step 7: Environment sanity + commit**

Run: `[ -d node_modules ] || npm ci` (the later tasks need the JS toolchain; `ls node_modules/.bin/tsx` must resolve — if missing, `npm ci`).

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/existence.rs crates/freshell-server/src/existence.rs
git commit -m "feat(existence): split ever_observed_on_disk from ever_observed (disk-only, ledger excluded)"
```

### Task 2: Pin 1 — claude never-conversed carve-out in `derive_verdicts` + flip the ruler pin

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs` (the `SessionExistence::Absent` arm, lines ~316–360; `mod tests` from line 375)
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts:1500-1503` (delete the ruler `test.fail`)
- Test: `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs` `mod tests`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `SessionExistenceProbe::ever_observed_on_disk(provider, session_id) -> bool` (Task 1); `ReconcileDeps.pane_ledger: &PaneLedger` with `ever_bound(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> bool`; existing helpers `base(pane, verdict)`, `corrected_flag(claim, resolved)`, `deps.registry.respawn_exhausted(&key)`.
- Produces: claude Absent-arm behavior — `Respawn` (carrying `session_ref`) for ledger-bound, never-disk-observed claude identities; unchanged `DeadSession{session_not_on_disk}` for disk-observed-then-deleted; unchanged everything else. The composed-ruler wall leg depends on this.

**Design decision (record in the code comment, verbatim rationale):** the carve-out mirrors the amplifier arm but is narrower — it requires (a) `sref.provider == "claude"`, (b) a durable ledger binding (`ever_bound`), and (c) the transcript never having been SEEN on disk (`!ever_observed_on_disk`). Condition (c) preserves the hazard guard within a boot (a deleted transcript that WAS observed stays an immediate `DeadSession{session_not_on_disk}` — existing test `row4_absent_but_ever_observed_yields_dead_session` keeps passing unchanged). Across a restart, a conversed-then-deleted transcript is indistinguishable from never-conversed by these signals; that case takes the same escape the amplifier arm already accepts — §7.5's `respawn_exhausted` convergence ends a respawn↔instant-exit loop in an actionable `DeadSession{respawn_exhausted}`, never thrash and never silent. **Verified real-CLI semantics (load-bearing validation, claude v2.1.220 binary inspection — `.the-usual-logs/wall-pins-closure/reports/V2-real-claude-contract.md`):** `--resume <not-found id>` prints an error and exits 1 in both the print and interactive entrypoints — it does NOT recreate a transcript. Against real claude this carve-out's value is therefore loud convergence (respawn → fast exit → respawn_exhausted → actionable DeadSession), while the wall's fake CLI accepts `--resume` and restores. A `--session-id` (start-intent) respawn was considered and REJECTED: real claude's in-use guard is disk-based, so it would SILENTLY start fresh under a conversed-then-deleted id — the exact silence this contract forbids. Coherence with PR #565: the locator fallback fires only when a transcript FILE EXISTS (converting false-Absent to Present ⇒ Respawn); this arm fires only in the true-Absent branch (file never created). Zero overlap, two halves of one rule: "a claude identity the disk has no memory of is respawnable; one the disk remembers and lost is dead."

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs` `mod tests`, after `amplifier_absent_even_observed_yields_respawn_not_dead_session` (~line 656). The fixture (`Fixture::new()` → `registry`/`identity`/`probe: FakeProbe`/`ledger: PaneLedger::new(Some(root))`), `pane(key)` (default mode `"claude"`), and `sref(provider, id)` builders already exist in this mod:

```rust
    /// PIN 1 red test: a claude pane whose session id was preallocated at
    /// create (ledger-bound, durable) but which NEVER conversed has no
    /// transcript file -> Absent. That is not an immediately-dead state:
    /// respawning with --resume mirrors the amplifier arm. Against the
    /// wall's fake CLI the pane restores; REAL claude (verified v2.1.220)
    /// errors-and-exits on a not-found id, which §7.5 respawn_exhausted
    /// converges to a loud, actionable DeadSession -- never silent.
    /// Kata 09v1's locator fallback covers
    /// exists-but-unparseable; this covers never-created.
    #[test]
    fn claude_never_conversed_yields_respawn_not_dead_session() {
        let f = Fixture::new();
        f.ledger
            .record_binding(&crate::pane_ledger::BindingWrite {
                provider: "claude",
                session_id: "s-never",
                terminal_id: "T-never",
                mode: "claude",
                cwd: None,
                create_request_id: Some("cr-never"),
                now_ms: 1_000,
            })
            .expect("record binding");
        let mut p = pane("cr-never");
        p.session_ref = Some(sref("claude", "s-never"));
        // Probe default: Absent, never observed on disk.
        let v = f.one(p);
        assert_eq!(v.verdict, ReconcileVerdict::Respawn);
        assert_eq!(v.session_ref, Some(sref("claude", "s-never")));
    }

    /// PIN 1 hazard guard: a claude transcript that WAS seen on disk and is
    /// now gone is a real data-loss shape — stays loud dead_session even
    /// though the identity is ledger-bound (rows 4/4b unchanged).
    #[test]
    fn claude_deleted_after_conversation_stays_dead_session() {
        let f = Fixture::new();
        f.ledger
            .record_binding(&crate::pane_ledger::BindingWrite {
                provider: "claude",
                session_id: "s-gone2",
                terminal_id: "T-gone2",
                mode: "claude",
                cwd: None,
                create_request_id: Some("cr-gone2"),
                now_ms: 1_000,
            })
            .expect("record binding");
        f.probe.mark_observed("claude", "s-gone2");
        let mut p = pane("cr-gone2");
        p.session_ref = Some(sref("claude", "s-gone2"));
        let v = f.one(p);
        assert_eq!(v.verdict, ReconcileVerdict::DeadSession);
        assert_eq!(v.reason.as_deref(), Some("session_not_on_disk"));
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify RED**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws --lib reconcile`
Expected: `claude_never_conversed_yields_respawn_not_dead_session` FAILS (today it derives `DeadSession` — `ever_observed` answers true via `ledger.ever_bound`... note: with `FakeProbe` and a real fixture ledger, the DeadSession gate reads `deps.existence.ever_observed` which for `FakeProbe` is its observed set only, so the observed verdict may be `Fresh{identity_never_observed}` instead — either way it is NOT `Respawn`, which is the assertion). `claude_deleted_after_conversation_stays_dead_session` PASSES already (it pins the guard so the fix can't break it). All pre-existing tests PASS.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the carve-out**

In `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs`, in the `SessionExistence::Absent` arm, immediately AFTER the amplifier carve-out block (which ends at line ~341 with `return ... Respawn`) and BEFORE the `ever_observed` dead-session gate (comment at ~:342):

```rust
            // Claude carve-out (never-conversed preallocation, PIN 1): claude
            // terminals get a server-preallocated --session-id at create and
            // the binding row is durable before the answer — but the
            // transcript file only appears on first output. Ledger-bound +
            // Absent + never SEEN on disk therefore means "created, never
            // conversed", not dead: Respawn is the actionable verdict. The
            // e2e fake accepts --resume and restores; REAL claude (verified
            // v2.1.220) errors-and-exits on a not-found --resume id, which
            // §7.5 respawn_exhausted converges to a loud DeadSession --
            // never silent (a --session-id start-intent respawn was
            // rejected: it would silently reuse a conversed-then-deleted
            // id). Kata 09v1's locator fallback
            // (freshell-server existence.rs) already converts
            // exists-but-unparseable into Present => Respawn; this arm covers
            // never-created — two halves of one rule, no overlap. A
            // transcript that WAS observed on disk and is now gone falls
            // through to the loud dead_session below (rows 4/4b hazard
            // guard). Cross-restart deleted-with-prior-conversation is
            // indistinguishable from never-conversed by these signals and
            // takes the same escape the amplifier arm accepts: §7.5's
            // respawn_exhausted convergence ends a respawn <-> instant-exit
            // loop in an actionable dead_session, never thrash.
            if sref.provider == "claude"
                && deps.pane_ledger.ever_bound(&sref.provider, &sref.session_id)
                && !deps
                    .existence
                    .ever_observed_on_disk(&sref.provider, &sref.session_id)
            {
                if deps.registry.respawn_exhausted(&key) {
                    return PaneVerdict {
                        session_ref: Some(sref),
                        reason: Some("respawn_exhausted".to_string()),
                        ..base(pane, ReconcileVerdict::DeadSession)
                    };
                }
                let corrected = corrected_flag(pane.session_ref.as_ref(), Some(&sref));
                return PaneVerdict {
                    session_ref: Some(sref),
                    corrected,
                    ..base(pane, ReconcileVerdict::Respawn)
                };
            }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify GREEN**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws --lib reconcile && cargo test -p freshell-server --lib existence`
Expected: ALL PASS — the two new tests plus every pre-existing decision-table test (`row4_absent_but_ever_observed_yields_dead_session` still passes: it has no ledger binding AND marks disk observation; `row4b_never_observed_identity_yields_fresh_not_dead_session` still passes: no ledger binding → carve-out doesn't fire; `amplifier_absent_even_observed_yields_respawn_not_dead_session` untouched — its arm precedes ours; `respawn_exhausted_key_yields_dead_session_not_another_respawn` at `:816` untouched).

- [ ] **Step 5: Rust gates + commit the fix**

Run: `cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace`
Expected: clean / all pass.

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs
git commit -m "fix(reconcile): claude never-conversed sessions respawn instead of dead_session (PIN 1)"
```

- [ ] **Step 5b: Update the collateral spec pinned to the old claude verdict (validated blast radius)**

Load-bearing validation found exactly one green e2e test that pins the behavior this carve-out inverts: `test/e2e-browser/specs/reconcile-client-adoption-rust.spec.ts:418-480` ("dead sessions → ONE batched panel") builds claude panes that are ledger-bound, deletes their transcripts while the server is down, restarts, and asserts the batched "Dead sessions" dialog. Under the carve-out that shape now derives `Respawn` (ever_bound + never observed on disk in the NEW epoch) — the dialog never appears and the test goes deterministically red.

Update the test to preserve its actual contract (multiple dead sessions batch into one panel) without depending on the claude deleted-while-down shape: switch the dead-session fixture panes to a provider WITHOUT an Absent-arm carve-out (codex or opencode — their Absent still derives `DeadSession`), or use an in-boot observed-then-deleted claude shape (which stays `DeadSession` per the hazard guard). Keep the batching assertions otherwise equivalent; do not weaken the contract.

Run: `npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium reconcile-client-adoption-rust.spec.ts`
Expected: red before the update (the batched-panel leg), green after it — record both in the commit body.

```bash
git add test/e2e-browser/specs/reconcile-client-adoption-rust.spec.ts
git commit -m "test(e2e): dead-session batching no longer keys on claude deleted-while-down (PIN 1 carve-out derives Respawn there)"
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Prove the ruler leg flips (RED signal = unexpected pass)**

Build and run the still-pinned ruler leg:

```bash
cargo build --release -p freshell-server
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts -g "THE RULER"
```

Expected: the run FAILS with Playwright's "passed unexpectedly" error for the `test.fail`-annotated ruler — that is the flip signal. (The ruler has `test.setTimeout(600_000)`; expect up to 10 minutes.)

(Baseline validation at `c1c67464` confirmed the ruler's only recorded error is the claude `--resume` argv poll at `:1753` — but the ruler aborts at its first failing await, so the sub-assertions AFTER `:1762` (codex/opencode resume, fresh* rehydration, etc.) have never executed under composition on this commit. A newly-surfaced red there is possible once the claude leg passes; it takes the contingency path below — re-diagnosis, never re-pin.)

**If instead the ruler still fails expectedly** (a leg OTHER than the claude `--resume` argv poll is red), do NOT delete the pin here — record the failing leg's error verbatim in the commit-message body of a `wip` note commit, continue to Task 3, and re-attempt this flip in Task 8 Step 2. If it still cannot flip there, HALT the workflow and report the evidence (never re-pin).

- [ ] **Step 7: Flip the pin**

In `test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts`, delete exactly the four lines at 1500–1503:

```typescript
    test.fail(
      e2eServerKind === 'rust',
      'P0.1: composed all-pane ruler; red until remaining P1.x land -- current observed red: the claude terminal §2.2 --resume argv leg under composition (the former P0.2 freshclaude identity gap closed in #562)',
    )
```

(Keep the explanatory comment above it only if it still reads true; otherwise trim it to a short note that the ruler is now a live assertion.)

- [ ] **Step 8: Run the flipped ruler leg green, twice**

Run (twice, sequentially):
`npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts -g "THE RULER"`
Expected: PASS both times. (The third stability run happens with the full wall in Task 8.)

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts
git commit -m "test(wall): flip the composed-ruler pin — claude never-conversed leg now green (PIN 1)"
```

### Task 3: Pin 3 server — pending-marker read → `fresh_by_race`, idempotent read-only

**Design decision (validated — supersedes the brief's one-shot consumption):** load-bearing validation FALSIFIED delete-at-derive consumption: the client re-sends `pane.reconcile` on EVERY WS ready precisely because a response can be dropped (`App.tsx:1029-1053` — "a result is not guaranteed (deferral, drop, error frame), so reconnect covers loss windows"), and the server's send is best-effort (`terminal.rs:76`). Consuming the marker before/around the send means a dropped response makes the retry derive a silent `no_recoverable_identity` — losing the breadcrumb to the exact churn Pin 3 exists to eliminate. The marker read is therefore READ-ONLY and IDEMPOTENT: every reconcile that still sees the marker derives the same loud `fresh_by_race`. Markers are still never promoted; locator resolution or the ledger's existing GC deletes them, and a recreated pane's new terminal id makes the old marker unreachable, so repeated breadcrumbs do not occur in practice. (Bonus: this keeps `pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts:182,246,318` — which pin markers PRESERVED across restart — green.) Accepted residual: a pane recreated by the census fallback under a new terminal id leaves its old marker dormant until GC (no breadcrumb — same as today for that shape).

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs` (the no-identity Fresh path at lines ~286–296; `mod tests`)
- Test: `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs` `mod tests`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `PaneLedger::pending_for_terminal(&self, terminal_id: &str) -> Option<PendingMarker>` (reader-rule: `None` if a binding row covers the terminal — `pane_ledger.rs:787`); `PaneLedger::record_pending(&self, terminal_id: &str, mode: &str, cwd: Option<&str>, now_ms: i64) -> io::Result<()>` (tests only); `ReconcilePane.terminal_id: Option<String>` (the client's stale pre-kill terminal id — the marker's key).
- Produces: new verdict reason string `"fresh_by_race"` on `Fresh` verdicts (free-form field — no contract regeneration), derived idempotently from the marker's presence. Task 4's client breadcrumb keys on the literal reason string `fresh_by_race`. No `terminal.rs` change and no deletion helper.

**Load-bearing verification folded in (Step 1):** the design claims the client re-presents the dead epoch's `terminalId` on post-restart reconcile (that is the marker join key — markers are keyed by `terminal_id`, and `createRequestId` is not stored on markers). The pinned leg itself proves the client retains it (its settle-poll at `:1988-1995` waits for `content.terminalId` to CHANGE from the pre-kill value, so the pre-kill value was present). Confirm the reconcile REQUEST carries it: `grep -n "terminalId" src/lib/pane-reconcile.ts | head -30` — the request builder must include the pane's current `terminalId`. If (and only if) it demonstrably does not, STOP this task and report: the fallback design (extending `PendingMarker` with an optional `create_request_id` field and joining on that) is a schema change that needs plan-review, not an inline improvisation.

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify the join key** (command above; record the matching line in the commit body).

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests**

In `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs` `mod tests`:

```rust
    /// PIN 3 red test (§4.2 pending-marker read): identity establishment was
    /// in flight when the server died (durable pending marker, keyed by the

            .expect("record pending");
        let mut p = pane("cr-race");
        p.mode = Some("opencode".to_string());
        p.terminal_id = Some("T-race".to_string());
        let v = f.one(p);
        assert_eq!(v.verdict, ReconcileVerdict::Fresh);
        assert_eq!(v.reason.as_deref(), Some("fresh_by_race"));
    }

    /// Delivery-safety pin (validated design change): the marker read is

    /// loud verdict, and the marker must still exist afterwards.
    #[test]
    fn marker_read_is_idempotent_across_reconciles() {
        let f = Fixture::new();
        f.ledger
            .record_pending("T-race2", "opencode", None, 1_000)
            .expect("record pending");
        let mut p = pane("cr-race2");
        p.mode = Some("opencode".to_string());
        p.terminal_id = Some("T-race2".to_string());
        let first = f.one(p);
        assert_eq!(first.reason.as_deref(), Some("fresh_by_race"));
        let mut p2 = pane("cr-race2");
        p2.mode = Some("opencode".to_string());
        p2.terminal_id = Some("T-race2".to_string());
        let second = f.one(p2);
        assert_eq!(second.verdict, ReconcileVerdict::Fresh);
        assert_eq!(second.reason.as_deref(), Some("fresh_by_race"));
        assert!(f.ledger.pending_for_terminal("T-race2").is_some());
    }

    /// Shell panes stay bare fresh even with a stray marker — the marker
    /// read sits behind the shell early-return.
    #[test]
    fn shell_pane_ignores_pending_markers() {
        let f = Fixture::new();
        f.ledger
            .record_pending("T-sh", "shell", None, 1_000)
            .expect("record pending");
        let mut p = pane("cr-sh");
        p.mode = Some("shell".to_string());
        p.terminal_id = Some("T-sh".to_string());
        let v = f.one(p);
        assert_eq!(v.verdict, ReconcileVerdict::Fresh);
        assert_eq!(v.reason, None);
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run to verify RED**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws --lib reconcile`
Expected: `pending_marker_yields_fresh_by_race_not_silent_fresh` and `marker_read_is_idempotent_across_reconciles` FAIL with reason `no_recoverable_identity`; `shell_pane_ignores_pending_markers` PASSES (pins existing behavior).

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the read**

In `crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs`, replace the no-identity else-branch (lines ~286–296) body:

```rust
    // No live terminal for this key — recover a retired identity if one exists.
    let Some(sref) = resolve_authoritative_ref(deps, pane, &key) else {
        // Row 8: shells are stateless by design; row 9: CLI with nothing to
        // resume becomes an explicit, labeled fresh — never a surprise.
        if pane.mode.as_deref() == Some("shell") {
            return base(pane, ReconcileVerdict::Fresh);
        }
        // §4.2 pending-marker read (PIN 3): a durable pending marker keyed by
        // the client's stale terminal id means identity establishment was in
        // flight when the server died — fresh by RACE, not by intent. The
        // reason is distinct and surfaced (client breadcrumb). The read is
        // deliberately IDEMPOTENT and read-only (amends §6 decision 5's
        // consumption clause): the client re-sends pane.reconcile on every
        // WS ready because a response can be dropped (App.tsx:1029-1053) —
        // consuming the marker at derive would turn that retry into a
        // silent no_recoverable_identity. Markers are still never promoted;
        // locator resolution or the ledger's GC deletes them, and a
        // recreated pane's new terminal id makes the old marker
        // unreachable.
        if let Some(tid) = pane.terminal_id.as_deref() {
            if deps.pane_ledger.pending_for_terminal(tid).is_some() {
                return PaneVerdict {
                    reason: Some("fresh_by_race".to_string()),
                    ..base(pane, ReconcileVerdict::Fresh)
                };
            }
        }
        return PaneVerdict {
            reason: Some("no_recoverable_identity".to_string()),
            ..base(pane, ReconcileVerdict::Fresh)
        };
    };
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Confirm no consumption wiring exists or is needed (delivery-safety design)**

No `terminal.rs` change: the derive path in `reconcile.rs` is the READ side's only touch point (see this task's design decision — delete-at-derive was falsified by load-bearing validation). Confirm and record in the commit body:

Run: `grep -n "delete_pending" crates/freshell-ws/src/*.rs`
Expected: call sites only in locator-resolution/exit-hook/GC paths and `pane_ledger.rs` itself — NONE in `handle_pane_reconcile`. (For reference, the alignment fact the old design leaned on was verified anyway: `derive_verdicts` is a total, order-preserving 1:1 map — reconcile.rs:45-64 — and `handle_pane_reconcile` passes untransformed `&request.panes` at `:3330`/`:3368`.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Run to verify GREEN**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws --lib reconcile && cargo test -p freshell-ws`
Expected: all three new tests PASS; every pre-existing test PASSES (the new arm only fires when a marker exists for the presented terminal id, and fixture ledgers start empty).

- [ ] **Step 7: Contract sanity (reason is not pinned)**

Run: `npm run contract:generate && git diff --exit-code -- port/contract && npm run test:port && cargo test -p freshell-protocol --locked`
Expected: no diff, all green.

- [ ] **Step 8: Rust gates + commit**

Run: `cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/reconcile.rs
git commit -m "feat(reconcile): pending-marker read derives loud fresh_by_race, idempotent read-only (PIN 3 server)"
```

### Task 4: Pin 3 client — `fresh_by_race` breadcrumb, DOM-visible

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/store/panesSlice.ts` (notice constants/function at lines ~601–605)
- Modify: `src/components/TerminalView.tsx` (notice write site `:4326` inside the effect at `:2991`; root JSX `:5228`)
- Create: `test/unit/client/store/panesSlice.fresh-by-race.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: server reason string `"fresh_by_race"` (Task 3), delivered unchanged through the existing fold (`pane-reconcile.ts:451-460` forwards `verdict.reason` → reducer → `reconcileFreshNotice(reason)` — no fold change needed; this satisfies the brief's "extend the client fold" intent at the layer where text is produced).
- Produces: `export const RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE` (exact text below — it must match the wall leg's regex `/couldn't be resumed|could not be resumed|fresh session/i`); a DOM element `data-testid="fresh-by-race-notice"` with `role="status"` rendered by `TerminalView` for ~10s when the notice is the fresh-by-race one. Task 5's e2e breadcrumb assertion depends on both.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing unit test**

Create `test/unit/client/store/panesSlice.fresh-by-race.test.ts`:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { reconcileFreshNotice, RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE } from '@/store/panesSlice'

describe('reconcileFreshNotice', () => {
  it('fresh_by_race renders the loud resumable-loss breadcrumb', () => {
    expect(reconcileFreshNotice('fresh_by_race')).toBe(RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE)
    // The restart-contract-wall probes /couldn't be resumed|could not be
    // resumed|fresh session/i — the breadcrumb must match it.
    expect(RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE).toMatch(/couldn't be resumed/i)
    expect(RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE).toMatch(/fresh session/i)
  })
  it('other reasons keep the generic machine-coded notice', () => {
    expect(reconcileFreshNotice('no_recoverable_identity')).toBe(
      'Started fresh (no_recoverable_identity).',
    )
  })
})
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify RED**

Run: `npm run test:vitest -- run test/unit/client/store/panesSlice.fresh-by-race.test.ts --config config/vitest/vitest.config.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE` is not exported.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the notice text**

In `src/store/panesSlice.ts`, extend the block at lines ~601–605:

```typescript
export const RECONCILE_NOTICE_CORRECTED = 'Session identity corrected by server — this pane now points at its live session.'
export const RECONCILE_NOTICE_DUPLICATE = 'A duplicate terminal for this session was detected and ignored.'
// PIN 3 (§4.2 "fresh by race, not by intent"): the server restarted while
// this pane's session identity was still being established — loud, distinct,
// and phrased to match the restart-contract wall's breadcrumb probe.
export const RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE =
  "This pane couldn't be resumed — the server restarted before its session identity was captured. Started a fresh session."
export function reconcileFreshNotice(reason: string): string {
  if (reason === 'fresh_by_race') return RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE
  return `Started fresh (${reason}).`
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify GREEN**

Same command as Step 2. Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: DOM-visible strip in TerminalView**

Today the notice is written into the xterm canvas (`writeLocalXtermNotice`) which Playwright's `getByText` cannot read. Add a DOM overlay for the fresh-by-race notice only (minimal blast radius — other notices keep their current xterm-only rendering).

In `src/components/TerminalView.tsx`:

(a) Add to the existing `@/store/panesSlice` import: `RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE`.

(b) At the component's top level, near the other `useState` hooks:

```typescript
  // PIN 3: the fresh-by-race breadcrumb must be readable by the DOM text
  // layer (assistive tech + the restart-contract wall's getByText probe) —
  // the xterm canvas write below is invisible to both.
  const [freshByRaceNotice, setFreshByRaceNotice] = useState<string | null>(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!freshByRaceNotice) return
    const t = setTimeout(() => setFreshByRaceNotice(null), 10_000)
    return () => clearTimeout(t)
  }, [freshByRaceNotice])
```

(c) At the `terminal.created` notice site (~line 4326, inside the effect at `:2991`), extend the existing block:

```typescript
          const createdReconcileNotice = contentRef.current?.reconcileNotice
          if (createdReconcileNotice) {
            writeLocalXtermNotice(term, `\r\n${createdReconcileNotice}\r\n`)
            if (createdReconcileNotice === RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE) {
              setFreshByRaceNotice(createdReconcileNotice)
            }
            dispatch(clearPaneReconcileNotice({ tabId, paneId: paneIdRef.current }))
          }
```

(Only the `if (createdReconcileNotice === ...)` lines are new; keep the rest byte-identical. The attach-path site at ~`:5040` is left unchanged — verified: a fresh verdict's fold clears `terminalId` and stores the notice (`panesSlice.ts:1948,1951,1982-1983`), so the drive effect takes the CREATE branch (`TerminalView.tsx:5009` vs `:5076`) and the notice is consumed at this site in the same handler invocation that sets the new `terminalId` (`:4258-4262`). Accepted residual: a dropped `terminal.created` that later routes via attach skips the overlay — low-probability, and Task 3's idempotent marker read re-labels the next reconcile anyway.)

(d) In the root JSX at ~line 5228, inside the `wrapperRef` div (which has `relative` when visible), as a sibling of the `containerRef` xterm div:

```tsx
      {freshByRaceNotice ? (
        <div
          role="status"
          data-testid="fresh-by-race-notice"
          className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-x-0 top-0 z-10 bg-amber-100/90 px-3 py-1 text-xs text-amber-900 dark:bg-amber-900/80 dark:text-amber-100"
        >
          {freshByRaceNotice}
        </div>
      ) : null}
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Lint + typecheck gates**

Run: `npm run lint && npm run test:vitest -- run test/unit/client/store/panesSlice.fresh-by-race.test.ts --config config/vitest/vitest.config.ts`
Expected: clean, PASS. (Full `npm test` runs in Task 8.)

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add src/store/panesSlice.ts src/components/TerminalView.tsx test/unit/client/store/panesSlice.fresh-by-race.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(client): DOM-visible fresh_by_race breadcrumb for race-lost pane identity (PIN 3 client)"
```

### Task 5: Pin 3 e2e — verify P1.10 is landed, flip the pin, prove re-capture

**Files:**
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts` (`SIGKILL-inside-locator-window` test at `:1933`; pin at `:1949-1952`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `data-testid="fresh-by-race-notice"` / breadcrumb text (Task 4); `fresh_by_race` verdict (Task 3); the leg's existing locals `sharedRoot`, `argLogPath`, `rowGatePath` (the `FAKE_OPENCODE_TERMINAL_ROW_GATE_PATH` value, deliberately never created pre-kill), `{ server, harness }`, `tabId`, `leaf`, helpers `readArgvLog`, `findLeafById`.
- Produces: an unpinned, strengthened wall leg — breadcrumb visible AND post-restart identity re-capture via the (already-landed) re-armed locator.

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify P1.10 is genuinely landed (load-bearing check on the brief's claim)**

The task brief said "verify it's genuinely un-landed, then build" — exploration found it IS landed: `maybe_arm` is called unconditionally at `terminal.rs:2319` (restore creates route through the same `handle_create`), and `OpencodeLocator::arm` gates only on missing identity (`opencode_locator.rs:194-196`). Confirm the pinning test passes:

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws restore_created_pane_without_identity_arms_and_resolves_into_the_ledger`
Expected: PASS (1 test). Do NOT rebuild the re-arm; the e2e assertion added in Step 4 proves it end-to-end. Record this command+result in the commit body.

- [ ] **Step 2: Prove the leg flips (unexpected pass)**

```bash
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts -g "SIGKILL-inside-locator-window"
```

Expected: FAILS with "passed unexpectedly" — the breadcrumb now matches `/couldn't be resumed|could not be resumed|fresh session/i` in the DOM. If it still fails expectedly, debug the breadcrumb chain (server verdict → reducer notice → DOM strip) before touching the pin; do not proceed on red.

- [ ] **Step 3: Flip the pin**

Delete exactly the four lines at 1949–1952:

```typescript
    test.fail(
      e2eServerKind === 'rust',
      'P1.8 (§2.4): SIGKILL inside locator window yields silent fresh, no breadcrumb',
    )
```

Update the leading `EXPECTED-FAIL WALL PIN` comment block (`:1938-1948`) to describe the now-live contract (keep the DETERMINISM note about the row gate — it still holds for the pre-kill phase).

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the re-capture assertion (re-armed locator, end to end)**

Immediately after the existing `expect(resumed || breadcrumbVisible).toBe(true)` (`:2007`), inside the same `try` block:

```typescript
      // P1.10 end-to-end (landed; pinned unit-side by opencode_association.rs
      // restore_created_pane_without_identity_arms_and_resolves_into_the_
      // ledger): the restore-created pane lacks identity, so the locator
      // re-armed at restore-create. Open the fake's row gate NOW and submit —
      // the re-armed locator must capture a ses_ identity post-restart.
      await fs.writeFile(rowGatePath, '')
      await page.locator('.xterm').last().click()
      await page.keyboard.type('hello again after restart')
      await page.keyboard.press('Enter')
      await expect
        .poll(async () => {
          const l = await findLeafById(harness, tabId, leaf.id)
          return l?.content?.sessionRef?.sessionId ?? null
        }, { timeout: 30_000 })
        .toMatch(/^ses_/)
```

(Use the leg's actual local names — verify with a read of `:1953-2010` that they are `rowGatePath`, `harness`, `tabId`, `leaf`; `fs` is the spec's existing `node:fs/promises` import. If the leaf lookup shape differs, mirror the leg's own settle-poll at `:1989-1995`, which reads `l?.content?.terminalId` the same way.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the flipped leg green, twice**

```bash
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts -g "SIGKILL-inside-locator-window"
```

Expected: PASS, twice sequentially. If the re-capture poll is the flaky part (locator window mechanics), investigate the row-gate machinery directly: the fake's gate-poll → db-row write (`test/e2e-browser/fixtures/fake-opencode-terminal.mjs`, writes the `ses_` row to the `XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/opencode.db` the locator watches) and the locator sweep (`opencode_locator.rs` — 150ms sweep; a late Enter re-opens an expired window). NOTE (validated): the `freshopencode` leg (`:1051`) is NOT a comparator — it uses the SIDECAR fake, not the row gate. `restartAbrupt` relaunches with identical env (`helpers/rust-server.ts:413-447,477-492`), so the gate env survives the restart. Do not delete the assertion to get green.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts
git commit -m "test(wall): flip SIGKILL-inside-locator-window pin — fresh_by_race breadcrumb + re-armed locator re-capture (PIN 3)"
```

### Task 6: Pin 2 server — instrument, then make claude identity durable BEFORE spawn

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs` (`handle_create` at `:1408`; insert pre-spawn write immediately before the PTY `spawn_blocking` at ~`:2195`; spawn-anchor comment)
- Create: `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal_create_ordering_tests.rs`
- Test: the new ordering test + the wall leg (Task 7)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: in-scope locals of `handle_create` immediately before the spawn: `terminal_id: String` (minted once at `:1572`), `mode: String` (`:1578`), `resume_session_id: Option<String>` (`:1618`; claude preallocation assigns `Some(Uuid::new_v4().to_string())` at `:1649`), `spec` (with `spec.cwd: Option<String>`, `:2109-2141`), `create.request_id`, `state: &WsState` (with `state.pane_ledger: Arc<PaneLedger>`); `PaneLedger::record_binding(&BindingWrite) -> io::Result<()>` (atomic write+fsync+rename+fsync-parent, keyed `(provider, session_id)` — a later re-write of the same key is benign); `surface_write_failure(state, terminal_id, result)`.
- Produces: durable claude binding row BEFORE the spawn that makes the id observable in argv; source-order regression pin `claude_binding_write_precedes_pty_spawn_in_handle_create`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Instrument — confirm the leg's red cause empirically (load-bearing stage)**

First confirm the pin is still red as claimed:

```bash
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts -g "SIGKILL-within-5s"
```

Expected: green suite result with the leg reported as "expected failure".

Then a single instrumented run to disambiguate the race (TEMPORARY, uncommitted): in the `SIGKILL-within-5s-of-pane-creation` test, immediately after `await server.restartAbrupt()` (`:1893`), insert:

```typescript
      // TEMP INSTRUMENTATION (do not commit): was the binding durable at kill?
      console.log('LEDGER BINDINGS AT KILL:',
        await fs.readdir(path.join(info.homeDir, '.freshell/pane-ledger/bindings')).catch(() => 'MISSING'))
```

(`info` is in scope in this leg; the Rust server's HOME is the fixture's isolated home dir — `applyIsolatedHomeEnvironment`, `test-server.ts:76-77` — exposed as `info.homeDir`; if the property name differs, read `test/e2e-browser/fixtures/rust-server.ts:295-310` for the accessor. `path` is already imported in the spec.)

Re-run the leg once and record the output verbatim in this task's final commit body:
- `MISSING` or `[]` → **Gap A confirmed empirically**: the SIGKILL beat the post-spawn binding write.
- a binding file present → the race did not materialize on this run; Gap B (Task 7) was the observed blocker. The pre-spawn write below still lands: the window is real at the code level (argv observable at `:2211`, durability only at `:2445`), and the leg's contract is "kill immediately after argv" — without tightening, green would be timing-luck.

Revert the instrumentation: `git checkout -- test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing ordering test**

Create `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal_create_ordering_tests.rs`:

```rust
//! P1.9 (D3) source-order pin: claude's preallocated identity becomes
//! OBSERVABLE at PTY spawn (`--session-id` in argv, logged synchronously by
//! the e2e fakes), so its durable ledger write must PRECEDE the spawn.
//! Reordering these reopens the SIGKILL-within-5s recovery hole
//! (restore-contract-wall `SIGKILL-within-5s-of-pane-creation`).

#[test]
fn claude_binding_write_precedes_pty_spawn_in_handle_create() {
    let src = include_str!("terminal.rs");
    let write = src
        .find("PIN2_CLAUDE_PRE_SPAWN_BINDING")
        .expect("pre-spawn claude binding block (PIN2_CLAUDE_PRE_SPAWN_BINDING) missing from terminal.rs");
    let spawn = src
        .find("PIN2_PTY_SPAWN_ANCHOR")
        .expect("PTY spawn anchor (PIN2_PTY_SPAWN_ANCHOR) missing from terminal.rs");
    assert!(
        write < spawn,
        "claude durable binding write must stay BEFORE the PTY spawn: durability precedes observability"
    );
}
```

Wire it in `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs` (top of file, next to any existing `#[cfg(test)]` mod wiring; same pattern as `recovery_inventory.rs`'s `#[path]` test module):

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
#[path = "terminal_create_ordering_tests.rs"]
mod terminal_create_ordering_tests;
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run to verify RED**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws claude_binding_write_precedes_pty_spawn`
Expected: FAIL — `PIN2_CLAUDE_PRE_SPAWN_BINDING missing`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the pre-spawn durable write**

In `crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs`, immediately BEFORE the PTY `spawn_blocking` whose `.await` is at ~`:2211` (i.e. just above the `let spawn_...` clones at ~`:2190-2195`), insert:

```rust
    // PIN2_CLAUDE_PRE_SPAWN_BINDING — P1.9 (D3) durability-before-
    // observability: a fresh claude create preallocates its --session-id
    // (:1649) and the spawn below makes that id OBSERVABLE (argv, logged
    // synchronously by the e2e fakes). A SIGKILL landing right after spawn
    // must still find a durable ledger row, or the recovery inventory has
    // nothing to offer after browser loss. The post-spawn binding write
    // (:2420 arm) re-records the same (provider, session_id) key with the
    // resolved cwd — a benign re-write. Failure policy identical to that
    // arm: never blocks the create, surfaced LIVE.
    if mode == "claude" {
        if let Some(session_id) = resume_session_id.as_deref() {
            let ledger = std::sync::Arc::clone(&state.pane_ledger);
            let write_session_id = session_id.to_string();
            let write_terminal_id = terminal_id.clone();
            let write_mode = mode.clone();
            let write_cwd = spec.cwd.clone();
            let write_request_id = create.request_id.clone();
            let now = now_ms();
            let result = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || {
                ledger.record_binding(&crate::pane_ledger::BindingWrite {
                    provider: "claude",
                    session_id: &write_session_id,
                    terminal_id: &write_terminal_id,
                    mode: &write_mode,
                    cwd: write_cwd.as_deref(),
                    create_request_id: Some(&write_request_id),
                    now_ms: now,
                })
            })
            .await
            .unwrap_or_else(|join_err| Err(std::io::Error::other(join_err)));
            crate::pane_ledger::surface_write_failure(state, &terminal_id, result);
        }
    }
```

And add the anchor comment on the line directly above the PTY `spawn_blocking` call (~`:2195`):

```rust
    // PIN2_PTY_SPAWN_ANCHOR: the spawn makes preallocated identity observable.
```

Notes for the implementer: (1) this fires for claude resume-creates too — the re-write retargets the existing `(provider, session_id)` row at the new terminal id pre-spawn. Validated benign: supersession keys on the freshly-minted tid, the two-bound-rows repair groups by tid, and every recovery path keys on `(provider, session_id)`, so the prior epoch stays recoverable even if this spawn fails or is killed mid-window; (2) `MARKER_MODES` correctly still excludes claude (claude has create-time identity and no post-spawn resolver — this write IS its durability story; record this answer to the brief's "should claude also get a marker?" question in the commit body: no — a binding row before spawn is strictly stronger than a marker); (3) the pre-spawn window for `MARKER_MODES` providers (their marker is also written post-spawn) is a known residual NOT exercised by any wall leg — do not fix it here (YAGNI; noted for a follow-up if a leg ever pins it).

- [ ] **Step 4b: Clean up the row when the spawn FAILS (validated gap)**

Load-bearing validation falsified "a row for a spawn-failed create is benign": the spawn-failure branch (`terminal.rs:2218-2275`) does no ledger cleanup, so a pre-spawn row for a failed FRESH claude create would surface as a ghost `ledgerOnly` recovery offer (a pane that never existed) for ~30 days. (Lock-safety at the insertion point WAS verified: only RAII guards already held across the existing spawn `.await` — no new hazard.)

Capture at the preallocation site (`:1649`) whether this create is a fresh claude preallocation (e.g. `let claude_fresh_prealloc = true;` alongside the `Uuid::new_v4()` assignment; `false` otherwise). In the spawn-failure branch, when `claude_fresh_prealloc` holds, delete the just-written row: use the ledger's existing binding-removal API (grep `pane_ledger.rs` for the deletion used by supersession/repair; if none is exposed, add `pub fn delete_binding(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> io::Result<()>` mirroring `delete_pending`'s atomic delete), wired through the same `spawn_blocking` + `surface_write_failure` pattern as the write. Do NOT delete on resume-creates — that row belongs to the prior epoch and must stay recoverable (validated, note (1) above).

Test: add a `pane_ledger` unit test `deleted_binding_row_is_gone_for_recovery_readers` (record binding → delete → the reader that feeds the recovery inventory no longer returns the row). The failure-branch wiring is covered by the per-task spec review plus the Step 2 ordering pin's anchors.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run to verify GREEN**

Run: `cargo test -p freshell-ws claude_binding_write_precedes_pty_spawn && cargo test -p freshell-ws && cargo test --workspace`
Expected: ordering test PASSES; full workspace green.

- [ ] **Step 6: Rust gates + commit**

Run: `cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`

```bash
git add crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal.rs crates/freshell-ws/src/terminal_create_ordering_tests.rs
git commit -m "fix(ws): claude binding row durable BEFORE PTY spawn — durability precedes argv observability (PIN 2 server)"
```

(Include the Step 1 instrumentation output verbatim in the commit body.)

### Task 7: Pin 2 e2e — fix the offer probe, flip the pin

**Files:**
- Modify: `test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts` (`SIGKILL-within-5s-of-pane-creation` test at `:1816`; pin at `:1825-1828`; probe at `:1919-1924`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: durable-before-spawn claude binding (Task 6); the shipped recovery offer UI — `data-testid="recovery-offer-panel"` (`RecoveryOfferPanel.tsx:190`), heading `Restore N panes from server memory?` (`:217`); the leg's locals `{ server, harness, info }`, `preallocatedId`.
- Produces: an unpinned, honestly-passing wall leg.

- [ ] **Step 1: Fix the probe (Gap B)**

The current probe can never match the shipped UI — `getByText(/recover .*pane/i)` vs the actual heading `Restore N panes from server memory?`. This is a broken test selector written before the panel existed (the green `recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts` uses the testid). Replace the offer arm inside the poll at `:1919-1924`:

```typescript
          const recoverOffer = await page
            .getByTestId('recovery-offer-panel')
            .isVisible()
            .catch(() => false)
          return recoverOffer
```

(The poll's other arm — a pane whose `sessionRef.sessionId === preallocatedId` — stays byte-identical; the contract is unchanged: auto-restored OR visibly offered.)

Validated note: do NOT assert WHERE the entry lives in the inventory (`ledgerOnly` vs the `device.tabs` arm) — a pre-kill tabs-snapshot push (subscribe-driven, un-debounced) may race the SIGKILL and relocate the row between the two arms across runs; either way `recoverable` stays true and the panel renders. The testid + `recoverable` are the stable contract.

- [ ] **Step 2: Prove the leg flips (unexpected pass)**

```bash
cargo build --release -p freshell-server
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts -g "SIGKILL-within-5s"
```

Expected: FAILS with "passed unexpectedly" — the ledger row now survives the kill (Task 6), the recovery inventory's `ledgerOnly` arm reports it, `recoverable: true`, the panel opens, the testid probe sees it. If it still fails expectedly, debug the chain in order: binding file present in `<homeDir>/.freshell/pane-ledger/bindings/` after kill → `GET /api/recovery/inventory` returns `recoverable: true` with a `ledgerOnly` entry → panel mounts. Do not proceed on red.

- [ ] **Step 3: Flip the pin**

Delete exactly the four lines at 1825–1828:

```typescript
    test.fail(
      e2eServerKind === 'rust',
      'P1.8+P1.9 (D3): pane created <5s before SIGKILL is unrecoverable after browser loss',
    )
```

Update the leading `EXPECTED-FAIL WALL PIN` comment (`:1821-1824`) to describe the now-live contract.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the flipped leg green, twice**

Same command as Step 2, twice sequentially. Expected: PASS both times.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts
git commit -m "test(wall): flip SIGKILL-within-5s pin — durable pre-spawn binding + correct recovery-offer probe (PIN 2)"
```

---

### Task 8: Full gates, wall stability ×3, push

**Files:**
- No new source changes expected (fix-forward only if a gate fails; each fix gets its own focused commit).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above.
- Produces: a pushed branch `fix/wall-pins-closure` with the wall green, zero pins, three consecutive full runs.

- [ ] **Step 1: Zero-pin audit**

Run: `grep -n "test\.fail(" test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts`
Expected: NO matches in code (prose mentions in comments are fine — verify each hit is inside a comment). Also `grep -rn "test\.fixme" test/e2e-browser/specs/restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts` → no matches.

- [ ] **Step 2: (Only if deferred from Task 2 Step 6) flip the ruler pin now**

If the ruler pin was left in place, re-run the ruler leg; on "passed unexpectedly", delete `:1500-1503` and commit as Task 2 Step 9 describes. If it STILL fails expectedly, HALT: report the failing leg's error verbatim — the wall cannot honestly reach zero pins and the workflow must surface that rather than re-pin.

- [ ] **Step 3: Rust gates**

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

Expected: all clean/green.

- [ ] **Step 4: Node gates (coordinator-aware)**

```bash
npm run test:status   # if held: wait 60s and re-check until free
FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY='wall pins closure' env -u FRESHELL_BIND_HOST npm test
npm run test:port
npm run lint
npm run contract:generate && git diff --exit-code -- port/contract
cargo test -p freshell-protocol --locked
```

Expected: all green; no contract diff.

- [ ] **Step 5: Release build + THE FULL WALL ×3**

```bash
cargo build --release -p freshell-server
for i in 1 2 3; do
  npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium restore-contract-wall-rust.spec.ts || { echo "WALL RUN $i FAILED"; break; }
done
```

Expected: three consecutive fully-green runs, zero pins, zero unexpected passes. Runs are sequential (shared host — never parallel). If any run fails: diagnose and fix forward (focused commit), then restart the 3× count from run 1. If a formerly-pinned leg cannot honestly stay green, HALT and report — never re-pin.

- [ ] **Step 6: Sibling e2e suites**

```bash
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium hidden-pane-rebind-rust.spec.ts
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium reconcile-client-adoption-rust.spec.ts reconcile-completion-rust.spec.ts reconcile-handshake-rust.spec.ts
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium recover-my-panes-rust.spec.ts
npx playwright test --config test/e2e-browser/playwright.config.ts --project=rust-chromium pane-ledger-restart-rust.spec.ts
```

Expected: all green (`recover-my-panes` guards Task 6/7 against regressions in the offer flow; the reconcile suites guard Tasks 2–4 — note `reconcile-client-adoption` was already updated in Task 2 Step 5b; `pane-ledger-restart` pins markers PRESERVED across restart, which Task 3's read-only design deliberately keeps true — validated blast radius).

- [ ] **Step 7: Push the branch — NO PR**

```bash
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD   # review: focused, atomic commits only
git push -u origin fix/wall-pins-closure
```

Do NOT open a pull request. Landing happens outside this workflow with the final review verdict.

---

## Self-Review (performed against the task spec)

**1. Spec coverage:**
- Pin 1 claude carve-out mirroring amplifier → Task 2. PR #565 coherence (two halves, no overlap) → Task 2 design decision + comment. Named red test `claude_never_conversed_yields_respawn_not_dead_session` → Task 2 Step 1. Composed ruler leg → Task 2 Steps 6–8. True-positive hazard guard → Task 2 `claude_deleted_after_conversation_stays_dead_session` (in-boot, direct) + `respawn_exhausted` convergence for the cross-restart shape (explicit design decision, mirrored from the amplifier arm's accepted tradeoff, and now grounded in VERIFIED real-CLI semantics — see the Task 2 design decision). Collateral blast radius (validated): the one green spec pinning the inverted claude verdict (`reconcile-client-adoption-rust.spec.ts`) is updated in Task 2 Step 5b.
- Pin 3 read side before generic Fresh, marker lookup by terminalId lineage, distinct surfaced `fresh_by_race` → Task 3 (the brief's one-shot consumption was FALSIFIED by delivery-semantics validation and replaced with an idempotent read-only design — Task 3's design decision). Client fold breadcrumb visible → Task 4 (reason already flows through the fold; text + DOM visibility are where the change bites — noted explicitly). Contract-pinned check → verified NOT pinned; gates still run generate/test:port/protocol (Tasks 3, 8). P1.10 "verify then build" → verified LANDED (Task 5 Step 1 evidence) + end-to-end re-capture assertion added to the leg (Task 5 Step 4). Red tests: unit marker→fresh_by_race (Task 3), e2e breadcrumb + re-capture + pin flip (Task 5).
- Pin 2 instrument FIRST → Task 6 Step 1 (empirical bindings-at-kill disambiguation, recorded). Candidate (a) boot-state unwired → disproven with evidence (wired via App.tsx:1926; green recover-my-panes e2e). Candidate (b) race → real code-level window; fixed by durability-before-spawn (Task 6). Claude marker question → answered explicitly (binding-before-spawn is strictly stronger; recorded in commit body). Red tests: wall leg (Task 7) + ordering pin `claude_binding_write_precedes_pty_spawn_in_handle_create` (Task 6, the unit-level pin on the broken link).
- Gates: fmt/clippy/cargo test, npm test with summary + coordinator wait, test:port, lint, release build, full wall ×3 with zero pins, hidden-pane-rebind + reconcile (+ recover-my-panes) suites, ephemeral ports, no-PR push → Task 8 + Global Constraints. Fix order Pin 1 → Pin 3 → Pin 2 → task order 1–7.

**1b. No silent deferrals:** every requirement lands as production behavior proven by an unpinned wall leg (no stubs/mocks/fakes standing in — the fake CLIs are the wall's own pre-existing harness, not new test doubles). One explicitly-scoped non-goal: the pre-spawn durability window for `MARKER_MODES` providers (markers also written post-spawn) — NOT part of any spec'd pin, not exercised by any wall leg, documented in Task 6 Step 4 note (3). This is a scope observation from investigation, not a spec requirement being deferred; no UNRESOLVED COVERAGE GAP exists against the spec.

**2. Placeholder scan:** two steps intentionally reference sibling-test fixtures by exact name instead of inlining unknown fixture internals (Task 1 Step 1 construction lines; Task 5 Step 4 leaf-lookup fallback note) — in both, the assertions and target behavior are fully specified and the referenced fixture is named with file+line. No TBDs, no "handle edge cases", no test-less "write tests" steps.

**3. Type consistency:** `ever_observed_on_disk(&self, provider: &str, session_id: &str) -> bool` used identically in Tasks 1 and 2; `RECONCILE_NOTICE_FRESH_BY_RACE` defined (Task 4 Step 3) matches the import (Task 4 Step 5) and the e2e regex (verified by the Task 4 unit test); `BindingWrite` field set (`provider, session_id, terminal_id, mode, cwd, create_request_id, now_ms`) is identical across Task 2, Task 3 (none), and Task 6, matching the existing write block at `terminal.rs:2434-2443`; the reason strings `fresh_by_race` / `no_recoverable_identity` / `session_not_on_disk` are used byte-identically across server, tests, and client.

**4. Load-bearing validation round (post-plan, pre-execution):** 12 assumptions surfaced, all resolved — full ledger at `/home/dan/code/freshell/.worktrees/.the-usual-logs/wall-pins-closure/load-bearing-ledger.md` (validator evidence in `reports/V1..V7`). Verified (8): ruler's sole red cause is the claude argv poll (baseline run, JSON reporter — 12 non-pinned legs green); Respawn→`--resume` argv has no downstream existence gate; the recovery-offer chain works with a binding row alone (referenced-row rule only relocates the entry); notice routes through the created site; verdicts are 1:1 with request panes; resume-create pre-spawn rewrite is benign; row-gate env survives `restartAbrupt`; wall baseline stable. Falsified (4), plan updated accordingly: real claude `--resume` does NOT recreate a never-created transcript (Task 2 rationale corrected; `--session-id` alternative rejected as silent-fresh-hazardous); delete-at-derive marker consumption loses breadcrumbs to reconnect churn (Task 3 redesigned read-only/idempotent); a pre-spawn row for a spawn-FAILED fresh create becomes a ghost offer (Task 6 Step 4b cleanup added); two green specs pinned inverted behaviors (Task 2 Step 5b spec update; `pane-ledger-restart` kept green by the Task 3 redesign and added to Task 8 Step 6). Accepted residuals are recorded in the ledger's "Acceptable decisions" section.
