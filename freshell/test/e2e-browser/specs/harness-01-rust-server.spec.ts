/**
 * HARNESS-01 self-test.
 *
 * Proves the owned Rust-server fixture end to end:
 *   1. Boots the real `freshell-server` binary, drives the actual browser UI
 *      through a shell pane, and confirms real PTY output round-trips.
 *   2. Spawns an unrelated sentinel process OUTSIDE the fixture's process
 *      group before teardown.
 *   3. restart()s the SAME owned server against the SAME isolated home/port/
 *      token and proves the reconnected client is functionally alive (a
 *      fresh command still executes) -- not just stale DOM content.
 *   4. Captures the REAL PTY shell child PID(s) (via `server.ownedChildPids()`)
 *      while the post-restart server is confirmed alive, then stop()s the
 *      fixture and proves: the server PID is dead; its OWN process-group
 *      leader is dead (`kill(-pid, ...)`, which reaches same-group
 *      descendants only -- NOT the PTY shell, which `setsid()`s into its own
 *      session/group, see `rust-server.ts`'s class doc comment); EACH
 *      captured PTY child PID is individually dead (the assertion that
 *      actually proves Rust-side reaping, since it is untouched by
 *      group-kill and would catch a regression in the server's graceful
 *      SIGTERM shutdown / `PtyTerminal` `Drop`-kill path); the port is
 *      freed; and the unrelated sentinel is still alive.
 *   5. Proves the REAL `os.homedir()/.freshell` was never created or modified.
