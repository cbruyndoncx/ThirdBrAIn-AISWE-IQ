#!/usr/bin/env bash
# GATE-01 slice runner. Runs ONE OR MORE spec files under BOTH gate projects
# (gate01-legacy + gate01-rust) with the pw lease held (300s heartbeat),
# then collates the JSON report into test/e2e-browser/gate01-baseline.json.
#
# Usage:
#   test/e2e-browser/gate01-run-slice.sh <run-id> <spec-file> [spec-file...]
#
# Slice groupings are listed in docs/plans/df1-evidence/GATE-01.md (appendix);
# the authoritative suite list comes from the collator itself.
#
# Required env (runner FAILS CLOSED without it):
#   FRESHELL_E2E_RUST_SERVER_BIN — absolute path to a pre-built
#     target/release/freshell-server FROM THIS WORKTREE AT THE CURRENT HEAD.
#     Rationale (helpers/rust-server.ts:110): the override skips the implicit
#     per-worker `cargo build --release`, so no cargo lease is needed here.
#     If this branch is rebased onto changed rust sources, REBUILD the binary
#     (under the cargo lease) before the next slice.
#
# Optional env:
#   DF1_HOLDER   lease holder id (default: df1-gate-01-unchanged-suite-both)
#   DF1_ACQUIRE  path to acquire.sh (default: the df1-control worktree copy)
#   GATE01_WORKERS  playwright workers (default: 2)
#   GATE01_PROJECTS comma list of gate projects to run (default: both legs,
#                 e.g. "gate01-rust" for an isolated rust-leg reproof)
#
# Lease discipline: acquire pw --wait 3600; heartbeat every 300s during the
# run; release in all exits. Retry/timeout policy: playwright config defaults
# (retries=0 locally) — flakes are proven by dedicated isolated re-runs, not
# auto-retry (see docs/plans/df1/GATE-01.md).
