//! TERM-04 — `terminal.create` requestId dedupe, NON-RESTORE path, at the WS
//! wire boundary (real axum server, real PTYs, real tokio-tungstenite clients).
//!
//! The restore-path legs live in `restore_spawn_gate.rs`
//! (`same_requestid_resend_returns_existing_terminal`,
//! `resend_on_new_connection_*`); the guard's branch-level truths live in the
//! unit tests of `crates/freshell-ws/src/create_dedupe.rs`. This file closes
//! the remaining acceptance gap: the acceptance semantics are path-agnostic,
//! and the plain (non-restore) create path — inline `handle_create`,
//! `begin()` -> spawn -> `settle()`/`clear_if_in_flight` — had no end-to-end
//! dedupe proof of its own. Coverage map (checklist: retry, reconnect,
//! delayed responses, two clients):
//!
//! - `plain_resend_same_connection_replays_settled_terminal` — retry on the
//!   same socket after settlement: replay, no respawn (the reply is a
//!   `terminal.created`, so a RATE_LIMITED error frame would fail the await —
//!   dedupe preceding the limiter is what makes this leg deterministic).
//! - `plain_resend_on_new_connection_replays_settled_terminal` — the lost
//!   response: the first client's `terminal.created` arrived but its pane is
//!   gone (socket dropped); the reconnect + second-client resend of the same
//!   requestId must be answered with the SAME terminalId and exactly one PTY
//!   must exist. (The pure in-flight-window waiter race is pinned by
//!   `restore_spawn_gate.rs`'s deliberately-unawaited pair and the unit
//!   suite's waiter tests; here the settled window is deterministic.)
//!
//! Contract note (legacy parity, `create_dedupe.rs` header): the replay
//! obligation holds while the first terminal is RUNNING; after an exit, a
//! re-sent requestId is indistinguishable from a fresh create and spawns a
//! new terminal. Both resend tests therefore assert the liveness
//! precondition explicitly so a dead-shell flake can never masquerade as a
//! dedupe violation.
