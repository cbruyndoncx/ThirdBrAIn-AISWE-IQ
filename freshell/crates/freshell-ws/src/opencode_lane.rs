//! Task 9: the per-terminal opencode SSE lane — the transport-only event
//! pump between one pane's embedded `opencode serve` (loopback HTTP+SSE) and
//! the activity hub's generation-guarded ingress
//! ([`ActivityHub::note_opencode_lane_event`]). Policy lives in the pure
//! tracker (`freshell-activity/src/opencode.rs`); this lane only gates on
//! health, subscribes, snapshots, translates, and reconnects.
//!
//! Cycle shape (Node `runMonitor:321-348` + `consumeEvents:411-471` parity —
//! connect BEFORE snapshot, A5):
//! 1. health-wait (bounded per cycle) + the log-once version drift gate;
//! 2. two-phase connect: resolves only on the FIRST `server.connected`
//!    frame, detected on the RAW decoded SSE event BEFORE
//!    `parse_serve_event` (which swallows it); frames past the ack are
//!    buffered by the returned handle, never dropped;
//! 3. `/session/status` snapshot — loss-free ONLY because the subscription
//!    already stands: every transition is either IN the snapshot or ON the
//!    open stream (/event has no replay; derives from opencode 1.18.11);
//! 4. flush the buffered frames in order, then pump live events, root-
//!    resolving unknown session ids over HTTP before forwarding (A4);
//! 5. backoff + reconnect with cycle/stream bumps.
//!
//! All IO is injected behind [`OpencodeLaneHttp`] / [`OpencodeEventStream`]
//! so the lane is unit-testable with fakes; the reqwest production impls
//! live at the bottom (wired at boot by Task 10).
