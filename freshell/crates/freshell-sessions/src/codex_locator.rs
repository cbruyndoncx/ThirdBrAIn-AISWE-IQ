//! Server-side codex terminal-pane session locator (Lane B2, campaign §2.3.2).
//!
//! Sibling of `opencode_locator` and the deleted `amplifier_locator` (a
//! provider-parameterized locator was explicitly rejected — the substrates
//! share zero code). Substrate: codex persists ONE JSONL rollout file per
//! session under a process-global sessions root
//! (`<CODEX_HOME|~/.codex>/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<threadId>.jsonl`,
//! flat `<id>.jsonl` in tests). A new session is a NEW FILE — so the locator
//! does a snapshot-diff of the file set, not a row-diff.
//!
//! Codex-behavior facts below are validated against codex source @
//! rust-v0.145.0 and a 3,858-rollout corpus; a codex upgrade re-opens them.
//!
//! Deliberate deviations from the opencode locator, with rationale:
//! - Windows are ENTER-ANCHORED ONLY — no spawn window. Real codex defers
//!   rollout file creation until the first user prompt is recorded
//!   (`RolloutRecorder` defers to `persist()`, materialized via
//!   `ensure_rollout_materialized()`), so before the pane's first Enter every
//!   new same-cwd rollout is by construction FOREIGN. `arm()` takes the
//!   known-files snapshot immediately but schedules NO deadline until
//!   `note_submit`.
//! - NO `pre_epsilon_ms` and NO created-at time bound: filesystems have no
//!   reliable cross-platform creation time (mtime moves on every append).
//!   The `known_files` snapshot is the primary safety — a file
//!   already present in the snapshot can never bind to this terminal. The FILENAME
//!   timestamp and the dated `YYYY/MM/DD` dir are never used as filters
//!   either: both are precomputed at codex session construction and can
//!   predate on-disk creation by the entire user idle gap (the dir can even
//!   be "yesterday" across midnight). The full-tree snapshot-diff sidesteps
//!   both.
//! - FIRST-SUBMIT re-snapshot (A4 hardening): the first `note_submit`
//!   replaces `known_files` with a fresh scan — strictly safe because the
//!   pane's own rollout cannot exist before its first Enter, so everything
//!   that appeared between arm and the first Enter is foreign by
//!   construction. SOUNDNESS PRECONDITION: the caller completes the first
//!   `note_submit` BEFORE the Enter byte is written to the PTY (codex
//!   materializes the rollout in response to that very Enter) — the
//!   `codex_association` submit seam encodes this ordering. Later window
//!   re-opens NEVER re-snapshot: a >2 s Enter→creation latency is recovered
//!   by a later Enter only if the pane's own late file stays a candidate.
//! - Attribution disambiguator: the rollout's own first-line
//!   `session_meta.payload.cwd` is REQUIRED and must match the armed
//!   terminal's cwd (`SessionMeta.cwd` is non-optional at 0.145.0;
//!   3,858/3,858 real rollouts carry it — accepting a no-cwd line would be
//!   pure foreign attack surface). `payload.cwd` is the codex process's
//!   physical `getcwd` path recorded verbatim; equality holds because
//!   `normalize_cwd` opportunistically canonicalizes the pane side — that
//!   canonicalize is load-bearing for symlinked spawn dirs.
//! - Pending first-line grace: codex CREATES the file, then awaits git-info
//!   collection (subprocesses, 5 s timeout each, worst ~10 s) BEFORE writing
//!   the `session_meta` line. A NEW file whose first line is empty/incomplete
//!   is a PENDING candidate: re-probed each sweep up to
//!   `PENDING_FIRST_LINE_GRACE_MS`, and while ANY pending candidate exists
//!   this terminal binds NOTHING (bind-blocking — a readable foreign file
//!   must not win while the pane's own file sits in its git-info gap).
//!   Enter→creation latency beyond the 2 s window is mitigated by this grace
//!   plus window re-open on a later Enter.
//! - Contested-cwd refusal is CROSS-TICK: while ≥2 contenders (armed
//!   terminals with in-flight evaluation windows) share a normalized cwd, no
//!   candidate with that cwd binds for any of them.
//! - Ownership is proven ONLY by `payload.id` on line 1 — NEVER the filename
//!   (prefilter-grade at best), NEVER `payload.session_id` (fork/resume
//!   LINEAGE: matches a FOREIGN session in 54/144 sampled real rollouts) —
//!   same predicate as `freshell-ws`'s `first_line_owns`.
//! - CLI-launch `codex resume <id>` appends to the EXISTING rollout file (no
//!   new file; statistically supported across thousands of freshell-launched
//!   sessions -- no live test) -- consistent with the arm gate refusing
//!   resume panes. In-TUI `/resume` is DIFFERENT: it MAY fork --
//!   INTERMITTENTLY (upstream bug openai/codex#34972; may be fixed away
//!   upstream): a NEW rollout file with a NEW session id, `forked_from_id`
//!   lineage and `thread_source:"user"` (verified on disk 2026-07-27,
//!   019fa60f -> 019fa613). The ForkWatch lane exists for exactly that case
//!   and is OPPORTUNISTIC/best-effort: when no fork happens it is simply
//!   idle. Compressed artifacts (`.jsonl.zst`) fail the `.jsonl` suffix
//!   filter.
//!
//! Zero cost when idle: scans happen only at arm, at the FIRST `note_submit`
//! (the re-snapshot), and at due Enter-anchored
//! evaluations (a pending candidate keeps its evaluation due, so re-probes
//! ride the same gate), proven by `fs_scan_count`. Callers run `arm()`,
//! `note_submit()`, and `tick()` inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` (cold
//! dentry cache is the one unmeasured tail — A6).
//!
//! FORK LANE (`watch_fork`/`note_fork_submit`/`tick_forks` — validated
//! A4/A13/A5): a second, independent lane for a BOUND pane, detecting codex's
//! in-TUI `/resume` fork (upstream openai/codex#34972: the child rollout
//! carries `forked_from_id` = the parent id + `thread_source: "user"`).
//! Ownership is proven by LINEAGE plus the user filter — lineage ALONE is not
//! proof (subagent forks dominate ~100:1 on the real substrate: 1,148 of
//! 1,160 forked rollouts; 86/340 codex-tui subagent children were born ≤30 s
//! after the parent's user input, i.e. inside the fork window). With the
//! `thread_source == "user"` filter the match is positive proof — NO cwd
//! census applies to this lane. Lane discipline:
//! - OPPORTUNISTIC / best-effort: /resume forking is INTERMITTENT ("Not
//!   every /resume produces a new ID") and may be fixed away upstream; when
//!   no fork happens the lane is simply idle — no correctness dependency.
//! - Known limitation (out of scope BY DESIGN): an in-TUI /resume to a
//!   DIFFERENT session yields `forked_from_id` = the SELECTED session's id,
//!   not the bound id — undetectable by this watch (rare: 12 user forks
//!   total on this machine's substrate).
//! - Accepted residuals (A5): a user-rebindable picker accept key (confirm
//!   without a pure-CR chunk) and kitty CSI-u Enter encoding (`CSI 13 u`
//!   instead of `\r`) would each silently defeat the Enter anchor —
//!   degradation = today's behavior, no corruption.
