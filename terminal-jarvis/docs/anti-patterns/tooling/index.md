# Tooling Anti-Patterns

Reaching for a slower or hand-rolled tool when a standard, installed one
exists.

## Entries

### Substring filters recursively launch a test's parent

**Pattern:** A subprocess invokes the current Rust test binary with a short
filter such as `heartbeat_probe`, also matching the parent's module path.

**Why it is wrong:** The child runs the parent again, recursively spawning
test binaries until memory, process limits, or the CI deadline is exhausted.
Reducing thread counts or increasing job timeouts masks the cause.

**Fix:** Use `--exact` with the fully qualified probe name, assert child
success and one executed test, and check selection with `--list` first.

### Plain grep when ripgrep is available (docs/)

**Pattern:** Content searches were issued with plain `grep -r` even where
`rg` was installed.

**Why it is wrong:** ripgrep honors `.gitignore`, skips binaries, and is much
faster on large trees; `grep -r` drags in vendored and ignored directories and
returns stale noise. The habit degrades search quality on every repo.

**Fix:** Use `rg` (ripgrep) for every content search. Fall back to plain
`grep` only when `rg` is not installed.

### Forgetting fzf for interactive selection (docs/)

**Pattern:** Interactive or terminal flows reach for hand-rolled pickers and
ad-hoc filters when a fuzzy finder is available on PATH.

**Why it is wrong:** A custom filter duplicates an installed, tuned tool and
produces a worse interaction for the reader.

**Fix:** Leverage `fzf` (fuzzy finder) for interactive selection of files,
lines, git objects, and history when it is present -- commonly piped from `rg`
(e.g. `rg <pattern> | fzf`). Write a custom picker only when `fzf` is absent.

### let-command-status leak kills set -eu pipelines (scripts/)

**Pattern:** `var=$(find ... | sort | while read -r x; do ...; done)`
where what looks like a failure-path-only exit (a trailing
`[ cond ] && echo` whose condition is false, or `read` hitting EOF)
becomes the loop's exit status, which becomes the whole command
substitution's status, which `set -eu` treats as a hard abort.

**Why it is wrong:** The script dies silently between two stages with no
error text; the failure is content-dependent (it passed until the last
sorted file in the tree happened to sit under the guard line). This one
ate half the verify pipeline in 0.1.14 pre-PR.

**Fix:** End the pipeline with `done || true` when the while body's last
command is conditionally non-zero, or make the body's final statement
unconditionally succeed. Reproduce deliberately when diagnosing invisible
`set -e` exits: the loop body's last command is the loop's status.
