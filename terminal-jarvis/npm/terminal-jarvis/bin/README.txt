terminal-jarvis npm launcher
============================

This directory contains the executable Node wrapper exposed by package.json#bin.
It is not the Rust CLI binary.

What it does:
- Honors TERMINAL_JARVIS_BIN when you want to execute an explicit local binary.
- In source checkouts, delegates to target/release, target/debug, or cargo run.
- In installed npm packages, downloads the matching GitHub Release archive,
  verifies the archive .sha256 file, caches the unpacked release, and executes
  bin/terminal-jarvis from that cache. Windows uses the native ZIP bundle and
  PowerShell extraction; other platforms use the portable tar.gz bundle.

Supported downloaded assets:
- linux-x64-gnu
- linux-arm64-gnu
- macos-x64
- macos-arm64
- win32-x64

Linux downloads require GNU libc. The launcher rejects musl/Alpine,
Android/Termux, unidentified libc, and unlisted architectures before download.
WSL2 with GNU libc selects the matching Linux GNU asset, but asset selection is
not a verified-environment claim. WSL1 is not claimed. Node 18.17 or newer is
required.

Native Windows npm installs use the win32-x64 asset from Command Prompt,
PowerShell, or Git Bash. If npm reports a stale terminal-jarvis binary earlier
on PATH, the install still completes; move the npm prefix earlier in PATH to
run the newly installed command.

Useful environment variables:
- TERMINAL_JARVIS_BIN: execute a specific local binary instead of downloading.
- TERMINAL_JARVIS_CACHE: choose the release cache directory.
- TERMINAL_JARVIS_NO_DOWNLOAD=1: require an already cached release.
- TERMINAL_JARVIS_RELEASE_BASE: override the GitHub Release asset base URL.

For source installs, use cargo install terminal-jarvis.
For binary installs, use Homebrew or this npm wrapper.
