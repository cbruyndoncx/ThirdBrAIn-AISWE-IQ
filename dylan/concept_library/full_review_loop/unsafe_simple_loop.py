Super Simple Claude Orchestration Script (Revised)

This script orchestrates Claude agents for a review loop, emphasizing
detailed prompting for Claude to manage file I/O directly. Python's role
is minimized to sequencing agents and simple decision checks.

Key principles:
- Claude agents are instructed to read and write their own files.
- Decision logic is simplified by Python checking for specific strings in Claude's output.
- Minimal Python code for orchestration, maximizing reliance on Claude's capabilities.

Your tasks are:
1.  Use git diff commands (or other appropriate git commands) to identify the specific code changes.
2.  Thoroughly analyze these changes for issues: bugs, style violations, performance concerns, security vulnerabilities, unclear logic, etc.
3.  For each identified issue, clearly state its priority (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW), the relevant file path, and line number(s).
4.  Provide specific, actionable suggestions for how to fix each issue.
5.  Structure your review report in Markdown format. It MUST include:
    - A "## Summary" section: Brief overview of the changes and key findings.
    - An "## Issue List" section: Detailed list of issues, categorized by priority.
    - A "## Recommendations" section (optional): Broader advice if applicable.
6.  At the VERY END of your entire response, include one of the following lines as the final line:
    - REVIEW_CONCLUSION: NEEDS_FIXES (if any CRITICAL or HIGH priority issues are found)
    - REVIEW_CONCLUSION: PASSED (if no CRITICAL or HIGH priority issues are found)

Think hard about this task. You are a Senior Code Reviewer conducting a re-review.

The code changes relate to: {COMPARE_DESC}.
All artifacts are in the output directory: {OUTPUT_DIR.resolve()}
{get_all_artifacts_context()}

Your tasks are:
1.  Read ALL previous reports in '{OUTPUT_DIR.resolve()}', especially the initial review, and the latest development report ('{dev_phase_filename}').
2.  Use git diff (or similar git commands) to examine the latest code changes made by the developer.
3.  Verify if the CRITICAL and HIGH priority issues identified in the previous review cycle have been adequately addressed.
4.  Check if any new issues (CRITICAL or HIGH) were introduced by the fixes.
5.  Format your re-review report in Markdown. It MUST include:
    - "## Re-review Summary"
    - "## Addressed Issues": Confirmation of fixes.
    - "## Remaining Issues": Any old issues not fully fixed.
    - "## New Issues": Any new problems found.
6.  At the VERY END of your entire response, include one of the following lines as the final line:
    - REVIEW_CONCLUSION: PASSED (if all CRITICAL/HIGH issues are resolved and no new major ones)
    - REVIEW_CONCLUSION: NEEDS_FIXES (otherwise)

IMPORTANT: After completing all tasks, you MUST save your ENTIRE re-review report to the file:
{OUTPUT_DIR.resolve() / rereview_filename}
Use the 'Write' tool. Start your report with "## Re-review - Iteration {loop_count}" and no other introductory text.

Think hard about this task. You are a Quality Assurance Validator.

The code changes relate to: {COMPARE_DESC}.
All artifacts are in the output directory: {OUTPUT_DIR.resolve()}
{get_all_artifacts_context()}

Your tasks are:
1.  Thoroughly review ALL previous reports in '{OUTPUT_DIR.resolve()}' to understand the full history.
2.  Perform a final quality check on the current state of the code (use git diff if needed).
3.  Assess overall code quality, maintainability, and whether all initial requirements appear met.
4.  Describe any conceptual tests you would run or expect to see.
5.  Format your validation report in Markdown. Include:
    - "## Overall Assessment"
    - "## Quality Checklist Verification"
    - "## Functional Verification (Conceptual)"

Think hard about this task. You are a Release Engineer responsible for CREATING a Pull Request.

The code changes for submission relate to: {COMPARE_DESC}.
All artifacts are in the output directory: {OUTPUT_DIR.resolve()}
{get_all_artifacts_context()}

All reviews and validation have passed. Your task is to:
1.  Synthesize a PR title and description.
2.  Actually CREATE the Pull Request using the `gh` CLI.
3.  Report on the outcome.

Your tasks are:
1.  Review ALL reports in '{OUTPUT_DIR.resolve()}' to synthesize a comprehensive PR title and description.
2.  Formulate a clear and concise PR Title.
3.  Formulate the full PR Description (in Markdown).
4.  **CRITICAL STEP: Create the Pull Request using the `gh` CLI.**
    a.  Use the 'Write' tool to save your formulated PR Description to a temporary file: `{pr_body_temp_file}`.
    b.  Then, using the 'Bash' tool, **EXECUTE** the `gh pr create` command.
        - Use the PR Title you formulated.
        - Use `--body-file "{pr_body_temp_file}"` to pass the description.
        - You might need to ensure the current branch is pushed and has an upstream remote set. If `gh pr create` can handle prompting for this or if you need to add a `git push --set-upstream origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME` command before it, please do so.
        - Example: `gh pr create --title "YOUR_ACTUAL_TITLE" --body-file "{pr_body_temp_file}"`
    c.  Capture the FULL output (both stdout and stderr) from the `gh pr create` command execution.
5.  After attempting PR creation (whether success or failure), you can use 'Bash' to delete the temporary file: `rm -f "{pr_body_temp_file}"`.
6.  Format your report on the PR creation attempt in Markdown. This report will be saved. It MUST include:
    - "## PR Title Submitted"
    - "## PR Description Submitted" (You can briefly state it was written to the temp file or include its content)
    - "## PR Command Executed" (The exact `gh pr create ...` command and any preceding git commands you ran)
    - "## PR Creation Result" (The full captured output from the `gh` command, including any PR URL, success messages, or errors)

IMPORTANT: After completing all tasks, you MUST save your ENTIRE report on the PR creation attempt to the file:
{OUTPUT_DIR.resolve() / pr_filename}
Use the 'Write' tool. Start your report with "## Pull Request Creation Attempt and Result" and no other introductory text.
