Agentic Review Loop

A collaborative workflow that orchestrates multiple Claude instances to review, develop, validate and create PRs.

This script:
1. Runs a Reviewer to analyze code changes and identify issues
2. Runs a Developer to implement fixes for issues found
3. Runs a Validator to verify fixes and ensure quality
4. Runs a PR Manager to create a pull request when all issues are fixed

Usage:
    # Compare latest commit to its parent (most common use case)
    uv run python concept_library/full_review_loop/full_review_loop_poc.py --latest

    # Compare a specific branch to main
    uv run python concept_library/full_review_loop/full_review_loop_poc.py --branch feature-branch

    # Compare current branch to another branch
    uv run python concept_library/full_review_loop/full_review_loop_poc.py --branch feature-branch --base-branch development

Options:
    --latest              Compare latest commit to previous commit (HEAD vs HEAD~1)
    --branch BRANCH       Branch to review (compared to base-branch)
    --base-branch BRANCH  Base branch for comparison (default: main)
    --max-iterations N    Maximum number of improvement cycles (default: 3)
    --output-dir DIR      Directory for output files (default: tmp/agentic_loop_TIMESTAMP)
    --verbose, -v         Show verbose output
    --no-pr               Skip PR creation even if validation passes
    --pr-title TITLE      Custom title for PR (default: auto-generated)
    --timeout N           Timeout in seconds for each agent (default: 600 - 10 mins)

Examples:
    # Review latest commit
    uv run python concept_library/full_review_loop/full_review_loop_poc.py --latest --verbose

    # Review feature branch compared to main
    uv run python concept_library/full_review_loop/full_review_loop_poc.py --branch feature-branch --verbose

    # Review with custom settings
    uv run python concept_library/full_review_loop/full_review_loop_poc.py --latest --max-iterations 5 --output-dir my_review --pr-title "Add configuration API"

Think hard about this task.

You are a senior code reviewer examining the changes in {self.compare_desc}.
Your task is to provide a thorough, critical review focused on:

1. Code quality and best practices
2. Architectural consistency
3. Error handling completeness
4. Input/output validation
5. Security issues
6. Performance concerns
7. Test coverage and quality

For each issue found:
1. Mark as CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW priority
2. Provide the file path and line number where the issue occurs
3. Explain the issue clearly with technical reasoning
4. Suggest a specific, actionable fix

First, run the following command to see what has changed:
```bash
git diff {self.compare_cmd}
```

Focus on understanding the changes and their context. Be thorough in your analysis.

Write your review in markdown format with the following sections:
1. Summary (overall assessment and key themes)
2. Issue List (all issues categorized by priority)
3. Recommendations (strategic suggestions beyond specific fixes)

Your review will be automatically saved and provided to a developer agent who will implement fixes.
Be thorough yet constructive in your feedback.

4. Test Results (results of running tests after your changes)

   - Are there any new issues introduced by the fixes? (Yes/No)
   - Do all tests pass? (Yes/No)
   - Is the code ready for PR? (Yes/No)
   - If not ready, what specific issues remain?

Be rigorous in your assessment - we want high-quality code.
Provide specific evidence and file paths for your conclusions.

Your validation report must end with ONE of these lines exactly as shown:
- VALIDATION: PASSED (if all critical and high issues are fixed with no new issues)
- VALIDATION: FAILED (if any critical/high issues remain or new issues were introduced)

Write your validation report in markdown format with the following sections:

2. Issues Assessment (evaluation of each critical/high issue from the review)
3. Test Results (output from running tests)
4. Code Quality Evaluation (assessment of overall code quality)
5. Conclusion (final determination with PASSED/FAILED status)

   - Read the development report at {self.dev_report_file}
   - Read the validation report at {self.validation_file} to confirm validation has passed

2. Only proceed if validation shows "VALIDATION: PASSED"

   - git diff {self.compare_cmd} --name-only  (to see which files changed)
   - git diff {self.compare_cmd}  (to see the actual changes)
   - git log -1 --pretty=format:"%s%n%n%b"  (to see the commit message)

4. Create a comprehensive PR description including:
   - Summary of changes
   - List of specific issues fixed (from the review)
   - Implementation details (from the dev report)
   - Validation results (from the validation report)
   - Testing performed
   - Any known limitations or future work

Follow these steps:
1. First, read all reports thoroughly to gather complete context

2. Next, check if validation has passed. Only proceed if it shows "VALIDATION: PASSED"

3. Run the git commands listed above to analyze what has changed

4. Generate a PR description with the following sections:
   ## Changes
   [Summary of what was changed and why]

   ## Issues Addressed
   [List of specific issues that were fixed, sourced from the review report]

   ## Implementation Details
   [Key implementation decisions and approaches from the dev report]

   ## Validation
   [Summary of validation results]

   ## Testing
   [Summary of tests performed]

   ## Notes
   [Any other information or future considerations]

5. Push the branch and create the PR using these commands:
   - git push -u origin {self.branch}
   - Create a PR description file: echo "$PR_DESCRIPTION" > pr_desc.md
   - Create PR: gh pr create --base {self.base_branch} --head {self.branch} --title "{title}" --body-file pr_desc.md

Make sure the PR description is thorough yet concise, focusing on what reviewers need to know.
Include the PR URL at the end of your report.
