```

**Browse all commands:**
```
/xhelp list
/xhelp categories
```

**Help and options:**
```

### Step 2: Handle "list" or "categories"

If $ARGUMENTS is "list" or "categories":
Display the full command registry table above, organized by category.
Stop and wait for input.

### Step 3: Handle Empty Input

If $ARGUMENTS is empty:
Tell the user: "Describe what you're trying to do and I'll recommend the right commands."
Show a few example queries:
- `/xhelp fix a flaky CI pipeline`
- `/xhelp improve test coverage`
- `/xhelp set up a new project with security`
Stop and wait for input.

### Step 4: Analyze the Problem

Parse $ARGUMENTS as a problem description. Match against these common workflow patterns:

### Step 5: Present Recommendations

Display recommendations in this format:

```
## Recommended Workflow for: [problem summary]

### Primary Commands (run in this order):
1. `/xcommand1` - [why this is needed first]
2. `/xcommand2` - [what this accomplishes next]
3. `/xcommand3` - [how this completes the workflow]

### Quick Start:
Copy and run these in sequence:
/xcommand1 [suggested args]
/xcommand2 [suggested args]
/xcommand3 [suggested args]

### Also Consider:
- `/xother` - [when this might help]
```

If the problem matches multiple patterns, combine the chains and deduplicate commands.

If no clear match is found:
- Suggest `/xexplore [topic]` as a starting point
- Show the 3 most likely relevant commands
- Offer to show the full command list with `/xhelp list`
