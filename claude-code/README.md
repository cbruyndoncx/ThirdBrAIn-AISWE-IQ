## 🔒 **Security Notice - Please Review Before Use**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This is an open source tool that will execute commands on your system. For your security:

### **Before Installation:**
1. **🔍 Review the source code** - Examine the files you'll be running:
   - **NPM package source**: [`claude-dev-toolkit/`](./claude-dev-toolkit/) - The published package code
   - **Commands directory**: [`slash-commands/active/`](./slash-commands/active/) - All command implementations
   - **Hook scripts**: [`hooks/`](./hooks/) - Scripts that integrate with Claude Code events

2. **🛡️ Understand what runs**: Commands will:
   - Execute bash/shell commands on your system
   - Read and modify files in your projects  
   - Make git commits and pushes
   - Install dependencies and tools
   - Run tests and linting tools

3. **🔐 Verify authenticity**: 
   - Check the [commit history](https://github.com/PaulDuvall/claude-code/commits/main)
   - Review [GitHub Actions tests](https://github.com/PaulDuvall/claude-code/actions) 
   - Examine the [MIT License](./LICENSE)

### **Recommended Security Practices:**
- Start with individual commands, not bulk installation
- Test in a disposable/sandbox environment first
- Review any command with `/x[name] help` before using
- Monitor what files are created/modified
- Keep your git history clean for easy rollback

### **🐳 Devcontainer for Safe Autonomous Execution**

Want to run Claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` safely? Use Anthropic's official devcontainer approach:

```bash
# Set up devcontainer with network firewall and security isolation
./setup-devcontainer.sh

# Or use the slash command
/xdevcontainer

# Start container and run Claude with full autonomy (safe inside container)
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Security features included:**
- **Network firewall**: Only allows api.anthropic.com, github.com, npmjs.org, pypi.org
- **Dropped capabilities**: `--cap-drop=ALL` prevents privileged operations
- **No privilege escalation**: `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`
- **Isolated filesystem**: No host mounts by default

**Setup options:**
```bash
./setup-devcontainer.sh --help              # Show all options
./setup-devcontainer.sh --dry-run           # Preview without creating files
./setup-devcontainer.sh --minimal           # Minimal tooling (Node, Git only)
./setup-devcontainer.sh --strict            # CI mode - fail if prerequisites missing
./setup-devcontainer.sh --allow-domain X    # Add custom domain to firewall allowlist
```

**Enterprise support:**
```bash
# Add private registries via environment variable
DEVCONTAINER_EXTRA_DOMAINS="npm.company.com,registry.internal" ./setup-devcontainer.sh
```

See our [Devcontainer Guide](./docs/devcontainer-guide.md) for complete documentation, or [Anthropic's official docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/devcontainer).

### 🔒 Code Quality & Security Hooks

PostToolUse hooks that **block Claude from proceeding** when code violates quality or security thresholds. Claude fixes violations immediately, then continues. Based on the approach described in [Code Quality Gates: Using Claude Code Hooks to Block Code Smells on Every Write](https://www.paulmduvall.com/claude-code-hooks-code-quality-guardrails/).

#### Four-Tier Scanner Model

Scanning is layered for feedback at the speed of typing, escalating to thorough only as the blast radius grows. Each tier is scoped tighter than the last and is **applicability-gated** — a scanner runs only when the change set contains a file type it analyzes, so an irrelevant change (e.g. editing a README) produces no output.

| Tier | Trigger | Budget | Scope | What runs |
|------|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 0 on-write | PostToolUse Write/Edit | <300ms | the one file written | inline Python smell + secret checks |
| 1 pre-commit | `git commit` | <5s | staged files | secrets + `checkov` on staged IaC |
| 2 pre-push | `git push` | <30s | push range | ASH (`precommit` mode) on changed files |
| 3 CI | PR / push to `main` | minutes | full tree | ASH (`container` mode), all scanners, SARIF + SBOM |

Every tier except CI is **file-scoped**. Cross-file and cross-resource analysis (e.g. a security group defined in one file and referenced in another) is **CI-only by design** — it would blow the smaller budgets. Tier 3 is the only un-bypassable tier. [AWS Automated Security Helper (ASH)](https://github.com/awslabs/automated-security-helper) backs Tiers 2–3; ASH never runs at Tier 0, since nothing in its bundle starts fast enough for a sub-300ms per-write gate. See [docs/ash-integration.md](./docs/ash-integration.md) for the wiring, benchmarks, and supply-chain posture.

#### Quick Setup

```bash
# Automated: symlinks the Claude Code hooks (Tier 0) and installs the chained
# git hooks (Tier 1 pre-commit, Tier 2 pre-push). Idempotent; any pre-existing
# git hook (e.g. beads) is preserved by chaining, not overwritten.
bash setup-hooks.sh

# Also merge the PostToolUse/PreToolUse config into ~/.claude/settings.json
# (opt-in; off by default so your global settings are never edited unless asked)
bash setup-hooks.sh --wire-settings

# Preview what it will do (no changes made)
bash setup-hooks.sh --dry-run

# Remove hooks cleanly (restores any chained hooks)
bash setup-hooks.sh --uninstall
```

Requires Python 3.8+. Tier 0 fires only once its config is in `~/.claude/settings.json` — use `--wire-settings` or merge `hooks/settings.example.json` by hand. Tier 3 (CI) needs no install; it ships in `.github/workflows/ash.yml`.

#### What Gets Checked

**Code Smells** (PostToolUse on every Write/Edit via `check-complexity.py`):

| Metric | Default Limit | What It Catches |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Cyclomatic complexity | 10 | Too many decision paths in a function |
| Function length | 20 lines | Functions doing too much |
| Nesting depth | 3 levels | Deep nesting that obscures control flow |
| Parameters per function | 4 | Functions that need decomposition |
| File length | 300 lines | Files that should be split |
| Duplicate blocks | 4+ lines, 2+ occurrences | Copy-paste code that belongs in a helper |

Language support:
- **Python**: Full AST analysis (all 6 checks) + ruff auto-fix
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Native token-based parser (all 6 checks, zero dependencies)
- **Go, Java, Rust, C/C++**: Via [Lizard](https://github.com/terryyin/lizard) (complexity, length, params)

**Security** (PostToolUse on every Write/Edit via `check-security.py`):
- **Secrets detection**: AWS keys, GitHub tokens, Stripe keys, OpenAI keys, private keys, credential URLs
- **Bandit-style checks** (Python): `eval`/`exec`, `shell=True`, pickle, hardcoded passwords, bare `except: pass`
- **Trojan source**: Unicode bidi overrides and zero-width characters (CVE-2021-42574)
- **Severity gate**: secrets and HIGH-severity findings **block**; findings below HIGH are reported to Claude without blocking. Secrets are **never suppressible**; honored `# smell|security: ignore[...]` suppressions are logged to `.quality-gate/suppressions.log`.

**Commit Signing** (PreToolUse on Bash via `check-commit-signing.py`):
- Blocks unsigned `git commit` commands
- Provides GPG and SSH signing setup instructions

#### How It Works

When Claude writes or edits a file, the hook:
1. Parses the file using language-specific analysis (AST for Python, token parser for JS/TS)
2. Checks against thresholds
3. If violations found: returns `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}` with specific fix instructions
4. Claude refactors the code and retries -- the hook fires again on the new version
5. Once clean, Claude continues normally

#### Customizing Thresholds

Create `.smellrc.json` in your project root to override defaults per-project:

```json
{
  "thresholds": {
    "max_complexity": 15,
    "max_function_lines": 30,
    "max_nesting_depth": 4,
    "max_parameters": 5,
    "max_file_lines": 500,
    "duplicate_min_lines": 6
  },
  "security": {
    "enabled": true,
    "trojan_enabled": true
  },
  "suppress_files": ["*_test.py", "conftest.py", "migrations/*.py"]
}
```

#### Inline Suppression

Suppress specific violations on individual lines:

```python
# smell: ignore[complexity,long_function]
def necessarily_complex_state_machine():
    ...

# security: ignore[B101]
assert condition, "This assert is intentional"
```

Suppressions apply to the annotated line and the line immediately following.

#### Manual Setup (Alternative to setup-hooks.sh)

If you prefer to configure manually, add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 $HOME/.claude/hooks/check-complexity.py"
          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 $HOME/.claude/hooks/check-security.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 $HOME/.claude/hooks/check-commit-signing.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then symlink the hook files:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
for f in check-complexity.py check-security.py check-commit-signing.py \
         config.py suppression.py smell_types.py smell_python.py \
         smell_javascript.py smell_checks.py smell_ruff.py \
         security_checks.py security_secrets.py security_bandit.py \
         security_trojan.py; do
    ln -sf /path/to/claude-code/hooks/$f ~/.claude/hooks/$f
done
```

#### Subagent-Based Hooks (Additional)

Lightweight bash hooks that delegate analysis to AI subagents:

```bash
hooks/pre-write-security.sh      # Security analysis via subagent
hooks/pre-commit-quality.sh      # Quality analysis via subagent
hooks/on-error-debug.sh          # Debugging assistance via subagent
hooks/pre-commit-test-runner.sh  # Auto-detect and run tests before commits
hooks/verify-before-edit.sh      # Warn about placeholder/fabricated references

## Technical Architecture

### Hybrid Hook Architecture
The hook system has evolved through two major architectural improvements:

**Phase 1: Monolithic → Modular (v1.0)**
- 333-line monolithic script → 8 specialized modules
- Eliminated god function antipattern and code smells
- Enhanced CLI, security, and error handling

**Phase 2: Complex → Hybrid (v2.0)**
- 253-line complex orchestration script → 4 lightweight trigger scripts  
- Bash complexity → AI-driven intelligence via subagent delegation
- Heavy orchestration → Simple context gathering and delegation

**Current Hybrid Architecture:**
- **4 lightweight triggers** (30-150 lines each) replacing complex bash logic
- **AI delegation** for complex analysis via specialized subagents
- **Preserved modular foundation** with 8 shared library modules

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Key guidelines:

- **Conventional Commits**: We use semantic versioning with automated releases
- **Development Workflow**: Fork, branch, test, and submit PRs
- **Testing Requirements**: 100% of tests must pass before merging
- **Code Standards**: Security-first development practices

### Quick Contribution Steps

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. **Make changes** following existing command development patterns
4. **Write tests** for your changes
5. **Use conventional commits**: `git commit -m "feat(xcommand): add new feature"`
6. **Push and create PR** targeting the `main` branch

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated releases:

```bash
# New features (minor version bump)
git commit -m "feat(xapi): add REST API testing command"

# Bug fixes (patch version bump)
git commit -m "fix(xtest): correct coverage report path"

# Breaking changes (major version bump)
git commit -m "feat(core)!: change command parameter structure

BREAKING CHANGE: All commands now use --parameter format"
```

**Supported types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`

### Automated Release Process

Releases are fully automated when commits are merged to `main`:

1. **Semantic-release** analyzes commit messages
2. **Version bump** determined automatically from commit types
3. **CHANGELOG.md** generated from commits
4. **GitHub release** created with release notes
5. **NPM package** published automatically
6. **Git tags** created for version tracking

Currently in **alpha** (0.0.x-alpha.y) until v1.0.0 production release.

### Command Development
1. Create new commands in `slash-commands/active/` or `slash-commands/experiments/`
2. Sync to npm: `bash scripts/sync-to-npm.sh`
3. Run tests: `cd claude-dev-toolkit && npm test`
4. Follow existing patterns and security best practices

### Hybrid Hook Development
1. **Lightweight Triggers**: Create focused trigger scripts (30-150 lines) following existing patterns
2. **Use Shared Libraries**: Leverage `hooks/lib/` modules for consistency and security
3. **AI Delegation**: Structure context and delegate complex logic to appropriate subagents
4. **Testing**: Support manual testing with environment variables (`CLAUDE_TOOL`, `CLAUDE_FILE`)
5. **Documentation**: Include usage examples and Claude Code integration patterns

**Example New Trigger**:
```bash
# hooks/my-custom-trigger.sh
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/config-constants.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/context-manager.sh"
# Gather context, delegate to subagent, provide clear user guidance
```
