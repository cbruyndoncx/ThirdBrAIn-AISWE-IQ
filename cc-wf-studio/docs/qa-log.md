# QA Log

Append-only memory of the quality-assurance loop (`next-qa`). One entry per
iteration, newest first. Kept separate from `docs/progress-log.md` on
purpose: the QA and feature tracks are promoted to `main` independently, so
sharing a log file would make every promotion conflict.

## 2026-07-26 — S7: `extractVariables`, the `{{var}}` detector behind the Prompt node
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user writes `{{language}}` in a Prompt node
  and the product stops telling them the variable is there — the canvas node's
  variable chips and the property panel's "Detected variables" section go empty
  or list the wrong names. Nothing fails: the export still succeeds, and the
  exported document's **Available variables** block is generated from a
  different source (`node.data.variables`), so the two silently disagree about
  what the prompt actually uses. The user ships a workflow whose documented
  variable list does not match its own prompt text, and it surfaces wherever
  the agent later runs.
- **Issue/PR**: #1066 / PR from `claude/qa-template-utils-variables`
- **Outcome**: done — 18 cases in a new
  `packages/vscode/src/webview/src/utils/template-utils.test.ts`. The module is
  dependency-free, so it runs under the existing webview `vitest.config.ts`
  with no new infrastructure. Every expected value was verified by **executing**
  the function, not read off the regex.
  - **A. Detection** (7 cases) — multiple variables, dedup, first-occurrence
    order, adjacency, newlines, `\w` admitting `_x` / `a1` / `1a`, and the
    empty results. Order is asserted with `toEqual` on the whole array rather
    than `toContain`: the chips render in this order and `Set` dedup preserving
    insertion order is the load-bearing detail, so a `toContain`-only case
    would pass on a sort regression.
  - **B. Silently undetected shapes** (6 cases + 1 pin) — hyphen, dot,
    `{{ name }}` (surrounding whitespace, the most likely thing a real user
    types), a non-ASCII name in a UI that ships five locales, single braces,
    and an unclosed placeholder. Each returns `[]` with **no** feedback: the
    panel section disappears rather than reporting that the placeholder was not
    understood. Plus a `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR` pin that `{{{name}}}` **does** match
    by backtracking one character — observed, not obviously desired, and
    nothing else in the repo recorded it.
  - **C. The cross-representation divergence** (1 case) — drives **both** sides
    on one fixture so neither half can pass alone: `extractVariables` returns
    `[]` for `{{my-var}}` while `generateExecutionInstructions` emits
    ``- `{{my-var}}`: …`` under **Available variables:**, because the generator
    (`workflow-prompt-generator.ts:939-945`) iterates `Object.entries` with no
    pattern check and `promptPropertySchema.variables` is
    `z.record(z.string(), z.string())`. Landed as a pin per the #1018 / #1031 /
    #1047 / #1058 / #1061 / #1064 precedent — passing today, red the moment
    either side is changed to agree with the other. **No bug filed, by the
    issue's instruction**: which side is wrong (widen the pattern, or validate
    the keys on entry) is a product decision, and the qa-log already records it
    for the feature track.
  - **D. Global-regex statefulness** (3 cases) — `VARIABLE_PATTERN` is a
    module-level `const` with the `g` flag, shared by every caller, and both
    consumers call it once per node per render. Covers: same input twice,
    X→Y→X, and `lastIndex === 0` after a matching call.
  - **Verified the suite bites** by hand-mutating `template-utils.ts` three
    times, each reverted (`git diff` on `packages/*/src` is empty):
    - dropping the `Set` dedup → **2 red**: *deduplicates a variable used more
      than once*, *preserves first-occurrence order rather than sorting*.
    - widening `\w` → `[\w-]` → **2 red**: *detects nothing for a hyphen in the
      name*, and the whole of section C.
    - the `lastIndex` leak → **10 red**, including all three of section D.
- **Correction to the issue's "Done when" clause**: it asserts that replacing
  `matchAll` with a `while ((m = re.exec(s)))` loop over the shared pattern
  "must turn section D red". **It does not** — that mutation was applied and
  the suite stayed fully green (18/18). A full drain loop is safe: `exec`
  resets `lastIndex` to 0 when it finally returns `null`. The leak needs an
  exit that does *not* drain, so the mutation was replaced with the shape that
  actually occurs in practice — a plausible early-out guard
  `if (!VARIABLE_PATTERN.test(promptText)) return [];` — which turned 10 cases
  red including all of section D. Worth carrying forward: `.test()` and
  partial/`break`-ing loops are the dangerous shapes here, a full `matchAll`
  or drain loop is not.
- **Bugs filed**: none — as the issue predicted, every case passes against the
  current implementation and nothing is skipped.
- **Residual scope on #1066**: none. `substituteVariables`,
  `getUndefinedVariables` and `isFullyDefined` (`:69`, `:92`, `:118`) remain
  deliberately untested — re-verified for this iteration that they still have
  zero consumers repo-wide, so the substitution half of the feature is unwired
  and testing it would be a transcription. Restated in the test file header so
  a later iteration does not re-litigate it; whether to wire it up is a product
  question for the feature track.

## 2026-07-26 — S2: user-text fences and the Prompt node variables block
- **Protects**: if this breaks — and it is broken today — the exported
  instruction document **ends early**. A user prompt containing a ` ``` ` code
  block closes the enclosing 3-backtick fence, so the rest of the prompt is read
  by the consuming agent as document prose; a prompt whose last line is a bare
  fence goes further and swallows the *whole* of the next node's subsection, so
  a node the user drew on the canvas is never executed at all. Every export
  surface is affected (`ccwf render`, the MCP `render_workflow` tool, "Copy as
  Markdown", all seven targets), prompts that ask an agent to write code
  routinely contain a fence, and nothing on the user's machine reports it: the
  export succeeds and the damage surfaces wherever the agent later runs.
- **Issue/PR**: #1063 / PR from `claude/qa-execution-instruction-fences`
- **Outcome**: done — 21 cases appended to
  `packages/core/src/services/workflow-prompt-generator.test.ts`.
  - **A. Fence containment** (12 cases, `describe.each` over the three
    embedding sites — Prompt node body `:934-936`, Sub-Agent `**Prompt**`
    `:776-778`, Codex `**Prompt**` `:886-888`). The asserted property is
    *"which lines of the document sit outside every fence?"*, computed by a
    small CommonMark-faithful `topLevelLines` scanner, **not** a transcription
    of the `sections.push` sequence. That distinction is the whole point: the
    pre-existing `:390` case spells out `` ```\n${prompt}\n``` `` and passes on
    the defect, because its fixture prompt only contains *single* backticks.
    Per site: a positive control (ordinary prompt stays contained, next node
    stays visible — must hold before *and* after the fix), plus three
    `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR (bug #1064)` pins — a ` ```bash ` block escapes, a
    trailing fence swallows the next node, and **four** backticks defeat a
    four-backtick fence too.
  - **Fourth exposure found while building**: the Codex `**Execution Command**`
    block (`:868-872`) interpolates the same prompt into the
    `codex exec … '<prompt>'` argument inside a ` ```bash ` block.
    `escapedPrompt` (`:862`) escapes `'` for the shell and nothing else, so a
    fenced prompt breaks that block too — and the command the user is told to
    run is wrong as well as unfenced. Pinned in its own case.
  - **B. The variables block** (`:939-945`, 8 cases). `grep -n variables` over
    the suite returned **nothing** before this, yet the field is live and
    AI-authorable (zod `prompt-schema.ts:29`, in the authoring guide,
    `NodePalette.tsx:264` seeds `variables: {}` on every new Prompt node) and
    `docs/quality/02-feature-map.md:123` rates it **A**. Covers: heading absent
    for `undefined` and for `{}` (the common shape, via the
    `Object.keys(...).length > 0` guard), the exact emitted line, insertion
    order preserved, the `(not set)` fallback for an empty value, and three
    pins — a newline in a value splits the Markdown list item so the remainder
    becomes prose (`CURRENT BEHAVIOUR (bug #1064)`), a backtick/pipe is emitted
    raw (observed, harmless today), and a non-`\w` key like `my-var` is
    advertised as available even though the webview's placeholder detector
    (`template-utils.ts:14`, `/\{\{(\w+)\}\}/g`) can never match it.
  - Landed **passing and named**, per the #1018 / #1031 / #1047 / #1058 / #1061
    precedent, rather than skipped — a skip would leave the most likely real
    failure uncovered while the feature loop decides.
  - **Verified the suite bites**: applied the sibling `fence()`
    (`workflow-overview-formatter.ts:576`) by hand to all four sites. Exactly
    the 10 fence pins went red and nothing else — the positive controls, the
    variables cases, and the 94 pre-existing cases stayed green. Reverted;
    `git diff` on `packages/*/src` is empty.
  - **Finding worth carrying to #1064**: patching only the three `**Prompt**`
    sites left the Codex site's pins *green*, because the unfixed
    `**Execution Command**` block breaks the document first and masks them. A
    partial fix of #1064 is therefore invisible at the Codex site — it must
    cover the exec block too.
- **Bugs filed**: **#1064** — the 3-vs-4 backtick divergence. Sibling of #1026
  (same root cause, different sites: #1026 is the MCP User Intent fence and the
  metadata comment, this is the three user-prompt sites plus the Codex exec
  block). The fix is already written and tested in the same directory —
  `workflow-overview-formatter.ts:576`'s `fence()`, whose own comment names
  exactly this case — so the fix is to reuse it, and one shared helper closes
  #1026 as well. Noted in the issue that four backticks are still not a
  complete answer (case 3 defeats them); the robust form measures the longest
  backtick run and opens with one more.
- **Residual scope on #1063**: none — sections A and B both landed, and the
  issue's section C exclusions were respected. Flagged there and repeated here
  for the **feature track**: `substituteVariables` / `getUndefinedVariables` /
  `isFullyDefined` (`template-utils.ts:69, :92, :118`) have zero consumers
  repo-wide, so the substitution half of the Prompt-variables feature is
  unwired while the feature map rates it **A**. That is a product question, not
  an assurance one — testing dead code would be a transcription.

## 2026-07-26 — S2: the Skill node's SKILL.md writer and reader
- **Protects**: if this breaks, one of two things happens and **neither reports
  anything on the user's machine**. On the write side, the user creates a Skill
  from the Skill Browser, the extension reports success and writes
  `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, and Claude Code silently never loads it
  because the frontmatter does not parse — the failure surfaces wherever the
  agent later runs. On the read side, a skill the user already has on disk
  disappears from the Skill Browser and can no longer be attached to a Skill
  node, because a `null` from `parseSkillFrontmatter` makes the caller drop it
  from the list (`skill-service.ts:69-71`, `:313-315`) with no error shown.
  `docs/quality/02-feature-map.md:128` rates the feature **A** with exactly
  these failure modes.
- **Issue/PR**: #1060 / PR from `claude/qa-skill-file-generator`
- **Outcome**: done — one new suite (22 cases),
  `packages/vscode/src/extension/services/skill-file-generator.test.ts`,
  covering `generateSkillFileContent` (`skill-file-generator.ts:50`) and
  `parseSkillFrontmatter` (`yaml-parser.ts:43`). Both had **zero test
  references anywhere in the repository** before this.
  - **A. Write shape**: the exact three-line frontmatter + blank line +
    instructions; `allowed-tools` emitted trimmed when present and asserted
    absent for `undefined` / `''` / `'   '` (the `.trim().length > 0` guard at
    `:58`); instructions preserved byte-for-byte.
  - **B. Read**: all three fields with the `allowed-tools` → `allowedTools`
    rename (the contract every caller depends on); values trimmed but a value
    containing `: ` kept whole; **a CRLF file parses identically to LF** — the
    deliberate contrast with bug #1031, where the sibling `parseAgentFrontmatter`
    reads a CRLF file as nothing at all; `null` for no frontmatter / no closing
    fence / a blank line before the opening fence; `null` when `description` is
    missing but `{ name: '', … }` when `name` is missing; a later `---` in the
    body does not extend the block.
  - **C. Round trip**: the load-bearing section — what `parseSkillFrontmatter`
    reads back equals the `CreateSkillPayload` that was written, payload object
    on one side and parsed object on the other, plus one case asserting the
    emitted block is accepted by **`yaml@2`** for an ordinary payload. Asserting
    the generator's output line-by-line would have been a transcription and
    would have passed on every defect in section D.
  - **D. Four pinned cases** naming bug #1061, asserted with `yaml@2` and not
    only with the in-house reader: a `: ` in the description and in
    `allowedTools` each emit a block real YAML rejects; a newline in the
    description injects an `allowed-tools` field the payload never declared; a
    multi-line description loses every line after the first. **Pinned, not
    skipped**, per the #1018 / #1031 / #1047 / #1058 precedent — the code does
    today what each case says, and a skip would leave the most likely real
    failure uncovered while the feature loop decides.
  - Verified the suite bites by applying `escapeYamlString` to `description`
    and `allowedTools` by hand: **all four section-D cases went red**, then
    reverted. `git diff` on `packages/*/src` is empty.
- **Test infrastructure landed in the same PR**: `packages/vscode` had no
  vitest setup at all — its `test` script only delegated to the webview, and
  the only config in the package was `src/webview/vitest.config.ts`. Added
  `packages/vscode/vitest.config.ts` (`environment: 'node'`,
  `include: ['src/extension/**/*.{test,spec}.ts']` — neither module imports
  `vscode` or touches the DOM, so no mocks and no jsdom), the `vitest` and
  `yaml` devDependencies, and changed the `test` script to run both. Checked
  before landing: `.vscodeignore` excludes `**/*.test.ts` **and**
  `src/extension/**/*.ts`, and `build:extension` is a `vite build` from the
  entry point, so nothing new reaches the VSIX (cf. the #1011 packaging
  regression).
- **Bugs filed**: **#1061** — the generator interpolates every user-typed value
  into the frontmatter raw, the fourth site of the #1009 / #1047 / #1058 family.
  The issue carries one finding the section-D cases alone would not have
  produced: the **round-trip** case shows that applying `escapeYamlString` is
  not a sufficient fix on its own, because it quotes on `,`, so an ordinary
  tool list `Read, Bash` is emitted as `"Read, Bash"` and `parseSkillFrontmatter`
  (`yaml-parser.ts:60`) has no unquoting step and reads the quotes back as part
  of the value. Whoever fixes #1061 must touch both directions.
- **Residual scope on #1060**: none — every case the issue specified landed.
  `skill-service.ts` itself stays out (it reaches the filesystem and VSCode
  configuration; §5 of the assurance map leaves host dependencies on manual
  E2E), as do `validateSkillName` / `validateCreateSkillPayload` in the webview
  and whether the Skill Browser renders the list.

## 2026-07-26 — S2: the Sub-Agent Flow agent file written on every CC export
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user builds a Sub-Agent Flow, exports, and
  the `.claude/agents/{workflow}_{flow}.md` that lands on disk either describes
  a different agent than the canvas holds — wrong model, missing tools — or
  carries a frontmatter block Claude Code cannot parse, in which case the
  nested agent **silently never loads**. Nothing on the user's machine reports
  it: the export succeeds, the file is written, and the failure surfaces
  wherever the agent is later run. Both export surfaces are affected
  (`cli/src/commands/export.ts:100`, `vscode/.../export-service.ts:36,59`),
  because both go through `planWorkflowExportFiles:381`.
- **Issue/PR**: #1057 / PR from `claude/qa-sub-agent-flow-agent-file`
- **Outcome**: done — one new suite,
  `packages/core/src/services/sub-agent-flow-agent-file.test.ts` (29 cases),
  plus `makeSubAgentFlow` / `subAgentFlowNode` builders added to the shared
  `__fixtures__/workflows.ts`. `generateSubAgentFlowAgentFile` had **zero test
  references anywhere in the repo** before this; `#1044` had named and skipped
  it once already.
  The asserted property is the same one `#1044` used, not a transcription of
  the generator: *the emitted frontmatter must parse as YAML, and parsing it
  must yield back the values the `SubAgentFlow` and its referencing node
  declared* — input objects on one side, parsed tree on the other.
  - **A** — round-trip: `name` verbatim from the caller-sanitized argument,
    `description` from the flow with the name as fallback, `tools`/`color`/
    `memory` asserted **absent** as well as present, `model` always emitted
    and defaulting to `sonnet`, all four CC models (incl. the `CC_ONLY_MODELS`
    `haiku`/`fable`) passing through, and all four node-sourced keys composing
    in one file.
  - **B** — the four `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR (bug #1058)` pins, landed **passing**
    per the #1018/#1031/#1039/#1042/#1047 precedent.
  - **C** — composition: fence → Mermaid → instructions in order, the *flow's*
    nodes rendered rather than the parent's, no `pseudoWorkflow` placeholder
    (`1.0.0`, epoch) leaking, and byte-identical output across calls with no
    clock stubbing.
  - **D** — planner level: the `<parent>_<flow>` path convention, the
    referencing-node lookup being by `subAgentFlowId` rather than position,
    and two pins-as-observed (orphan definition still gets a sonnet file;
    two flow names that sanitize alike plan the **same** `relativePath` twice
    and the second write wins on disk — the collision the #1008 iteration
    flagged for sub-agent names and left unfiled).
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating and reverting four things: the
    `|| 'sonnet'` default (`:129`), the `tools.length > 0` guard (`:140`), the
    `subAgentFlow.description ||` fallback (`:137`), and the `referencingNode`
    lookup (`:376`). Each produced a **named** failure (3/3/3/1 cases). The
    candidate #1058 fix was also applied experimentally: it turns exactly the
    four `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR` cases red and nothing else. All reverted —
    `git diff` on `packages/*/src` is empty.
- **Bugs filed**: **#1058** — `description` (`workflow-export.ts:137`) and
  `tools` (`:141`) are interpolated raw while `generateSlashCommandFile` 50
  lines below escapes its own `description` (`:191`). A colon-space or a
  newline in either takes the whole agent file down, and
  `validateClaudeFileFormat` passes it because it never parses the block. Third
  site in the #1009 / #1047 family.
- **#1057 section E resolved — no defect.** The issue asked whether a
  `description` typed in the Sub-Agent Flow property panel is dropped, since
  the generator reads `subAgentFlow.description` rather than the node's. It is
  not: `description` in `subAgentFlowPropertySchema`
  (`sub-agent-flow-schema.ts:24`) declares **no `control`**, and
  `SchemaPropertyPanel.tsx:85` skips control-less fields, so it is data-only
  and never editable. The panel shows the *flow's* description read-only in its
  Header slot, and `workflow-store.ts:1249,1274` copies the flow's value into
  the node on save. The node field is a mirror; the flow is the source of
  truth, and the generator reads the right one. Pinned as a precedence
  assertion rather than left as a comment. **No follow-up needed** — the next
  iteration should not re-investigate this.
- **Residual scope on #1057**: none — sections A–D all landed, and E is closed
  above. Out-of-scope items the issue named (`generateSubAgentFile`, the
  `generateMermaidFlowchart` / `generateExecutionInstructions` internals under
  #995) were not touched.
- **Housekeeping note for a human**: #1057 could not be locked by the session
  that filed it, so unlike the other `auto-generated` `qa` issues it still
  accepts non-collaborator comments. `gh issue lock 1057`.

## 2026-07-26 — S1: panel option sets vs. what the field's zod accepts
- **Protects**: if this breaks, a property-panel dropdown offers a value the
  node's own zod type rejects. The user picks it, `updateNodeData` stores it,
  the file saves — and the workflow then fails validation for a value the
  product itself offered: `validateNodeSchemaFields`
  (`validate-workflow.ts:257`) runs `propertyField.zod.safeParse(value)` on
  every field present on node data, so `ccwf validate` exits 1 and the MCP
  `apply_workflow` write is refused, on a workflow the user never hand-edited.
  The mirror-image break is quieter: a value zod accepts but the panel stops
  offering becomes unreachable from the UI with nothing failing anywhere.
- **Issue/PR**: #1046 / PR from `claude/qa-panel-options-consistency`
- **Outcome**: done — one new suite,
  `packages/core/src/schema/panel-options-consistency.test.ts` (43 cases).
  Nothing in the repository read `meta.options` or `SUB_AGENT_COLORS` before
  this; `authoring-guide-consistency.test.ts` checks the *authoring guide*
  against zod and never looks at what the panel renders.
  - **Premise re-verified on `auto-qa`.** Every value set the issue names
    agrees today — the 8 `SUB_AGENT_COLORS` keys match both colour enums, and
    all 12 select/radio option lists match their zod. **No divergence found,
    so the suite lands fully green with nothing skipped and no `bug` issue
    filed**, exactly as the issue predicted.
  - **One correction to the issue's numbers**: it says "All 13 do today" of
    the select/radio fields; the registry actually exposes **12** (plus 2
    `control: 'color'` fields, which carry no `options` — the picker reads
    `SUB_AGENT_COLORS` directly). The suite pins the 12 by id, so the count is
    now asserted rather than counted by hand.
  - **Covered**: section A, the load-bearing direction — parameterised over
    the registry, every offered value must satisfy the field's own
    `safeParse`, and every select/radio must have a non-empty `options`
    (`SelectControl.tsx:21` falls back to `[]`, so a field that loses it
    renders an empty dropdown with no error). Section B is the reverse
    direction, enum value set equal to `options` as a set, with `codex.model`
    allowlisted by name (`allowCustom: true` + a `z.string()` zod, so its
    list is a suggestion, not the accepted set). Section C covers the colours
    across all three representations, stated generically over the registry.
  - **Enum introspection worked cleanly against the installed zod 4.4.3** —
    `_zod.def.type === 'enum'` plus `.options`, unwrapping one `.optional()`
    layer via `_zod.def.innerType` — so section B landed in full and the
    issue's "assert only the importable-constant fields" fallback was not
    needed.
  - **Three cases the issue did not ask for**, each closing a way the suite
    could pass vacuously: the registry still exposes the 12 known select/radio
    ids and the 2 known colour ids (every other case is filtered on
    `control`), and a canary asserting the enum value set can still be read
    off all 11 enum-backed fields — if a zod bump moves `_zod.def`, that fails
    by name instead of section B silently covering nothing. Also asserted the
    `codex.model` exemption stays justified (still `allowCustom`, still
    non-enum, still accepts an unlisted model), so the allowlist entry cannot
    outlive its reason.
  - **Verified the suite bites** by hand-mutating and reverting five things,
    each producing *named* failures: a 9th key in `SUB_AGENT_COLORS` → both
    colour fields; an extra `'ai-drafted'` in `codex.promptMode`'s options →
    A2 plus B for that field; a 4th value in the `skill.scope` zod enum only →
    B for that field; deleting `codex.reasoningEffort`'s `options` → A1 plus
    B; and a simulated zod-internals rename → the canary, by name. The
    working tree was confirmed clean of `packages/*/src` changes afterwards.
- **Bugs filed**: none — every option set agrees with its zod on `auto-qa`
  today. This is a drift guard, not a bug report.
- **Note on PR #1049**: that PR (a **fork**, by another author) also targets
  #1046. The loop may not merge, build or push to it, so it stays labelled
  `needs-attention` for a human — who may now want to close it as superseded.
  #1046 had been deferred by the two previous iterations for its sake; with
  #995 blocked on a human spec revision it was the only buildable issue left,
  and deferring a third time would have meant building nothing.
- **Residual scope on #1046**: none of the issue's own cases are left out.
  Its two explicitly out-of-scope items stay out: `DEFAULT_CONTROLS` coverage
  (needs `packages/vscode`, since it imports the React controls) and "every
  schema field is renderable" (needs an allowlist and a decision about which
  dialogs own which data-only fields).

## 2026-07-26 — S1: getArrayBounds vs. what the array field's zod accepts
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the property panel's array editor offers an Add
  or Remove button the node's own zod type forbids. The user clicks it,
  `updateNodeData` stores the array, the file saves — and the workflow then
  fails validation for an edit the product itself offered:
  `validateNodeSchemaFields` (`validate-workflow.ts:257`) runs
  `propertyField.zod.safeParse(value)` on every field present on node data, so
  a 3-branch IfElse makes `ccwf validate` exit 1 and the MCP `apply_workflow`
  write refused, on a workflow built entirely through the canvas UI. The
  mirror-image break is quieter: bounds reported where none exist, so the Add
  button never appears and a legitimate 3rd Switch case becomes unreachable
  from the UI with nothing failing anywhere.
- **Issue/PR**: #1054 / PR from `claude/qa-array-bounds-consistency`
- **Outcome**: done — one new suite,
  `packages/core/src/schema/array-bounds-consistency.test.ts` (16 cases).
  `getArrayBounds` had **zero test references** in the repository before this,
  and no test asserted any array bound.
  - **Premise re-verified on `auto-qa`.** All four `objectArray` fields carry
    the bounds the issue names (`askUserQuestion.options` `.min(2).max(4)`,
    `branch.branches` `.min(2)`, `ifElse.branches` `.length(2)`,
    `switch.branches` `.min(2).max(10)`), and every measurement in the issue
    reproduced exactly against the installed zod **4.4.3**, including the two
    section-D observations. **No divergence found — the suite lands fully
    green with nothing skipped**, so no `bug` issue was filed.
  - **Covered**: section A, the load-bearing part — parameterised over the
    registry, it relates what `getArrayBounds` introspects to what the same
    zod type actually accepts (minimum length passes, one fewer fails, empty
    passes when no minimum is claimed, maximum passes and one more fails, 25
    pass when no maximum is claimed, item columns present). Section B pins the
    four production shapes individually with `toEqual` on the whole returned
    object, since A names a field but not the shape that broke. Section C is
    the zod-internals canary. Section D pins the two observed limits (no
    `ZodOptional` unwrap; string length checks report as bounds).
  - **Why C is a transcription on purpose**: it restates the implementation's
    dependency contract on zod's private `_zod.def.checks`, so a zod bump fails
    with "zod renamed the check" rather than only "the branch panel disagrees
    with its validator". Said so in the file header so nobody deletes it as a
    transcription by mistake. The fragility is real: all three packages declare
    `"zod": "^4.4.3"` — a **caret** range — and if the internals move the
    function returns `{}` for every field with no type error, because every
    access is already `unknown` and optional-chained.
  - **Added one case the issue did not ask for**: an assertion that the
    registry still exposes exactly the four known `objectArray` field ids.
    Every other case in A is parameterised over that filter, so without it a
    renamed control kind would make the whole section pass vacuously.
  - **Verified the suite bites** by hand-mutating and reverting each of the
    five changes the issue names. Each produced *named* failures, matching the
    issue's predictions: deleting the `min_length` arm → 10 failures (A1/A3 for
    three fields, B7/B8/B10, D14); deleting `length_equals` → 4 (B9 plus
    `ifElse`'s A1/A3/A5); `checkDef.minimum` → `checkDef.min`, the shape a real
    zod rename would take → the same 10 via an `undefined` bound rather than a
    missing one; `return {}` unconditionally → 16; adding `.max(6)` to
    `askUserQuestion.options` → B7 only, with A4/A5 still passing because they
    follow the schema.
- **Bugs filed**: none — every bound agrees with its zod on `auto-qa` today.
- **Residual scope on #1054**: none — all 14 cases the issue names landed, plus
  the vacuity guard above. `ObjectArrayControl`'s derived predicates
  (`fixedLength`, `showAdd`, `canRemove`) stay out per the issue: asserting
  them for real needs React rendering, which
  `docs/quality/03-assurance-map.md` §5 leaves on manual E2E.
- **Note on #1046**: still not picked. PR #1049 (a **fork**, by another author)
  targets it; the loop may not merge, build or push to that PR, so it remains
  labelled `needs-attention` for a human. #1054 was chosen partly because the
  issue states it shares no file, field or assertion with #1046.

## 2026-07-26 — S1: the Sub-Agent Flow validation family in validateAIGeneratedWorkflow
- **Protects**: if this breaks, an external agent's `apply_workflow` lands a
  workflow whose `subAgentFlow` node points at a `subAgentFlowId` that has no
  definition in `subAgentFlows`, and validation passes. The user opens the
  canvas, the nested-flow node is there, double-clicking it opens nothing, and
  every generated artifact — the Mermaid subgraph, the execution instructions,
  the exported `SKILL.md` — describes a flow that does not exist. Nothing on
  the user's machine reports it; the divergence surfaces wherever the agent is
  later run.
- **Issue/PR**: #1050 / PR from `claude/qa-sub-agent-flow-validation`
- **Outcome**: done — 24 cases appended to
  `packages/core/src/utils/validate-workflow.test.ts`. All three
  sub-agent-flow functions ran **zero times** under the suite before this:
  `validateSubAgentFlowReferences` (`:191`), `validateSubAgentFlowNode`
  (`:492`) and the exported `validateSubAgentFlow` (`:540`). They are not a
  zod transcription — they enforce cross-node invariants a schema cannot
  express (does the referenced flow exist, does the nested flow have exactly
  one Start), which `docs/quality/03-assurance-map.md` §6 names as the class
  that does need tests.
  - **Covered**: the reference contract (a dangling `subAgentFlowId` names the
    offending node in `field`, one error per node, a missing `subAgentFlows`
    array does not throw); the reference node's own fields
    (`SUBAGENTFLOW_MISSING_REF_ID` / `_MISSING_LABEL` / `_INVALID_PORTS`,
    including that an **omitted** `outputPorts` fails the strict `!==`); the
    definition (`_MISSING_ID` / `_MISSING_NAME`, the early return on a
    non-array `nodes`, the Start/End counts carrying the flow **name** since
    those three errors have no `field`, the two MVP node prohibitions, all
    broken rules reported rather than the first, and one case driving the
    public entry point so the `:215-218` wiring is covered too).
  - **Verified the suite bites** by hand-mutating and reverting four things:
    the early return at `:196`, the `!subAgentFlowIds.has(...)` condition at
    `:204`, the `!==` at `:515`, and the `subAgentNodes.length > 0` guard at
    `:597`. Each produced a named failure (1, 3, 1 and 2 cases respectively).
  - **Deliberate non-assertions**, recorded in the file header:
    `SUB_AGENT_FLOW.NAME_PATTERN` (`/^[a-z0-9_-]+$/`), `NAME_MAX_LENGTH` and
    `DESCRIPTION_MAX_LENGTH` are declared and never read, and the authoring
    guide's own worked example (`"name": "Input Validation"`) violates the
    pattern. The two representations contradict each other, so asserting
    either would pin an arbitrary answer.
- **Bugs filed**: **#1051** — the authoring guide states six sub-agent-flow
  MUST-rules and the validator enforces three. `askUserQuestion`,
  `branchSession` and the 100-node cap go unenforced (`MAX_NODES` at
  `workflow-definition.ts:737` is declared and read by nothing), while the
  **frozen** chat-UI path does check `askUserQuestion`
  (`refinement-service.ts:977`) — so the live MCP path is the looser of the
  two. Filed with three further holes in the same family: a definition is
  never inspected while nothing references it, two definitions may share an
  `id`, and an orphan definition is never reported. Seven cases land as
  **passing** `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR (bug #1051)` pins rather than skipped, per
  the #1031 / #1042 / #1047 precedent — a skipped test says nothing when the
  behaviour changes, whereas a pin goes red the moment the feature loop closes
  a gap.
- **Note on #1046**: not picked this round. PR #1049 (a **fork**, by another
  author) targets it; the loop may not merge, build or push to that PR, so it
  was labelled `needs-attention` for a human and left alone.

## 2026-07-26 — S2: the slash-command frontmatter emitted by generateSlashCommandFile
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user sets a model, a tool allowlist, an
  argument hint or a hook in the Slash Command Options dropdown, exports, and
  the emitted `.claude/skills/{workflow}/SKILL.md` carries different values
  than the canvas holds — or a frontmatter block Claude Code cannot parse at
  all, in which case the whole skill silently never loads. Nothing on the
  user's machine reports it; the divergence surfaces wherever the agent is
  later run.
- **Issue/PR**: #1044 / PR from `claude/qa-slash-command-frontmatter`
- **Outcome**: done — one new suite,
  `packages/core/src/services/slash-command-frontmatter.test.ts` (26 cases).
  `generateSlashCommandFile` had **zero test references** in the repository
  before this (`workflow-export.test.ts` covers only `nodeNameToFileName`),
  despite hand-building six conditional option lines plus a four-level
  hand-indented `hooks:` block.
  - **Parser choice**: `yaml@2` added to `packages/core` devDependencies, per
    the issue's instruction to pick one and record it. Chosen over `js-yaml`
    because it is ESM-native and needs no separate `@types` package. This is a
    `package.json` change only — no `packages/*/src` was touched.
  - **The property asserted** is not "the generator emits these lines" — that
    would be a transcription of the generator and would pass on every defect
    below. It is: *the emitted frontmatter must parse as YAML, and parsing it
    must yield back the `SlashCommandOptions` object the workflow declared.*
    Input object on one side, parsed tree on the other.
  - Sections: (A) conditional emission, each key asserted **absent** as well as
    present — the `'default'` sentinels for `model`/`context`, the
    truthiness-guarded `disable-model-invocation: false`, the
    camelCase→kebab-case rename asserted key by key, and the
    `description` → `workflow.name` fallback; (B) the hooks block round-tripped
    by `toEqual` against the input object, both the matcher and matcher-less
    branches, two hook types at once, and `once: false`; (C) escaping;
    (D) agreement with `validateClaudeFileFormat`, which the extension runs on
    every file before writing.
  - **Verified the suite bites** by hand-mutating the generator six ways, each
    producing a *named* failure: dropping the kebab-case rename, removing the
    `'default'` sentinel guard, shifting the hooks `command:` indentation by
    two spaces (5 failures), removing the matcher escaping (3), removing the
    command escaping (1), and — the important one — **applying the #1047 fix,
    which turns exactly the five `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR` cases red and nothing
    else**. All mutations reverted; `git diff` on `workflow-export.ts` is empty.
  - The first matcher fixture (`Bash("x")`) turned out **not** to hold the
    escaping — it round-trips fine as a plain scalar — so three matchers that
    are genuine YAML control constructs were added (`*`, `Bash: git commit`,
    `[Edit]`), plus a command containing a colon-space. Those are what make
    the `alwaysQuote` argument load-bearing in the suite.
- **Bugs filed**: **#1047** — `argumentHint` (`workflow-export.ts:211`) and
  `allowedTools` (`:195`) are interpolated **raw**, while `description` two
  lines above goes through `escapeYamlString`. The **documented** hint format
  (`workflow-definition.ts:69`: `"[arg1] [arg2] | [alt1] | [alt2]"`) opens an
  unterminated YAML flow sequence, so a user following the doc comment exactly
  produces a frontmatter that does not parse — taking the entire SKILL.md
  down, not just the hint. `[message]` parses as a **list** instead of a
  string; `allowedTools` containing `: ` throws the same way. Worse,
  `validateClaudeFileFormat` returns ok for all of them, which is why it ships
  silently (pinned as case D18). Landed as five **passing**
  `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR (bug #1047)` cases per the #1018/#1031/#1039 precedent,
  so the suite is green today and goes red when the feature loop fixes it.
- **Not filed, pinned as observed**: `hooks: { PreToolUse: [] }` emits a bare
  `hooks:` line (`hooks: null` once parsed) — the outer guard counts keys and
  the inner counts entries, and nothing closes the gap. Confirmed
  **unreachable from the canvas** per the issue (`removeHookEntry`,
  `workflow-store.ts:556-563`, deletes the key with its last entry), so it
  affects only hand-edited or AI-authored files. Also the newline-stripping in
  `escapeYamlString` (`:54`), which joins `'Line one\nLine two'` into
  `'Line oneLine two'` — the already-filed #1009 family, recorded rather than
  filed a second time.
- **Residual scope on #1044**: none — all 18 cases the issue names landed, plus
  the four added during mutation testing. Items the issue put out of scope
  (`generateSubAgentFile`, `generateSubAgentFlowAgentFile`,
  `planWorkflowExportFiles`, the document body) stay out; #995's item 3
  remains blocked on a human revising the stale `spec.md`, and this issue did
  not depend on it.

## 2026-07-26 — Packaging: keep the test suite out of the published dist/
- **Protects**: if this stays broken, every `@cc-wf-studio/{core,cli,mcp}`
  tarball ships this loop's test suite, so a consumer's deep import into any
  of those paths resolves a module that `import`s `vitest` — a devDependency
  absent from their install — and the `.d.ts` surface carries test modules.
  Not breakage (nothing reachable from an entry point imports a test), but a
  sharp edge that grows with every suite the QA loop lands.
- **Issue/PR**: #1011 / PR from `claude/qa-exclude-tests-from-dist`
- **Outcome**: done — **no product source changed**; the diff is three
  `tsconfig.json` files, three new `tsconfig.test.json` files, and the three
  `check` scripts.
  - **Premise re-verified and larger than filed.** #1011 measured 29 stray
    artifacts in `packages/core/dist` alone. A clean `pnpm build` on `auto-qa`
    HEAD (087445c) emitted **62**, across all three published packages —
    `core` (22), `cli` (16), `mcp` (12), plus both `__fixtures__` directories.
    `cli` and `mcp` had acquired the defect exactly as the issue predicted.
  - **Fix**: `src/**/*.test.ts`, `src/**/*.spec.ts` and `src/**/__fixtures__/**`
    added to `exclude` in each package's `tsconfig.json` (core's pre-existing
    `scripts` entry kept). vitest reads `vitest.config.ts`, not `tsconfig.json`,
    so its `include: ['src/**/*.{test,spec}.ts']` is untouched.
  - **The trade-off #1011 flagged was taken deliberately as option (b).**
    Excluding tests from `tsconfig.json` would have stopped `tsc --noEmit`
    from type-checking them, silently dropping the only static check the test
    files get. Each package now carries a `tsconfig.test.json` that extends
    the build config, re-includes everything, and never emits; `check` is
    `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.test.json`. Build and check now read different
    configs on purpose — that is the whole mechanism, and the comment at the
    top of each `tsconfig.test.json` says so.
  - **All three of the issue's "Done when" clauses verified by hand**:
    a clean `pnpm build` leaves `find packages/*/dist \( -name "*.test.*" -o
    -path "*__fixtures__*" \)` **empty**; `pnpm test` is green from the root
    (437 passed, 4 skipped, 21 files); and a deliberate `const x: number =
    "not a number"` appended to a test file in **each** of the three packages
    still fails `check` with `TS2322` (verified per-package, since the
    repo-wide run short-circuits at `core`). `pnpm --filter @cc-wf-studio/mcp
    run smoke` also still passes, and the three `dist` entry points are intact.
  - **Not touched**: `packages/vscode`. Its webview tests are bundled by vite
    from entry points and never reach the VSIX, and it publishes no npm
    tarball — outside #1011's subject, so left alone rather than swept in.
- **Bugs filed**: none — this is packaging hygiene in build config, not a
  product defect, and the QA loop is the track that introduced it.

## 2026-07-26 — S6 (sixth slice): entering, leaving and cancelling a Sub-Agent Flow
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user opens a Sub-Agent Flow, edits the
  nested canvas, closes it — and what lands back in the parent workflow is not
  what they drew. `setActiveSubAgentFlowId` is the **only** writer of nested
  flow contents into `subAgentFlows`, which is written straight to disk
  (`workflow-service.ts:98`) and read by every exporter, so a lossy round trip
  corrupts the saved file *and* every generated artifact — and the canvas shown
  after closing the dialog is the corrupted version, so nothing surfaces it.
- **Issue/PR**: #1041 / PR from `claude/qa-sub-agent-flow-enter-exit`
- **Outcome**: done — 19 passing cases in a new sibling suite,
  `packages/vscode/src/webview/src/stores/workflow-store-sub-agent-flow.test.ts`.
  **No product source changed.** Notes:
  - No new infrastructure: fifth store suite under the webview
    `vitest.config.ts` that landed with #1014. The action's *conversions* had
    **no coverage at all** before this — the two existing references
    (`workflow-store-history.test.ts:398,418`) drive it only to assert the
    undo/redo stacks. Those are deliberately **not** re-asserted here.
  - Sections follow the three transitions plus the two related actions:
    **A** enter (canvas conversion, snapshot by content, both halves of
    `isNewSubAgentFlow`, and the not-found early return asserted by identity),
    **B** exit (write-back into the matching entry *only*, `name` falling back
    to the node id, the `'default'` port fallback, both branches of `hasRef`
    with the count asserted each way), **C** switch (save-then-load, and the
    snapshot surviving so the later exit still restores the parent),
    **D** cancel, **E** `removeSubAgentFlow` while the flow is open.
  - One asymmetry pinned that the history suite does not reach: the not-found
    early return at `:1136` is the single path that skips the
    `temporal.clear()` at `:1351`, so a failed open leaves undo intact.
  - Two divergences pinned as observed rather than judged: the exit conversion
    defaults ports to `'default'` where `serializeWorkflow` uses
    `'output'`/`'input'`, and an unknown *switch* target commits the save-back
    before bailing out (unlike the atomic no-op on enter).
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating five things and reverting each:
    the `isNewSubAgentFlow` predicate (3 named failures), the `hasRef` check
    (2), the `|| 'default'` port fallback (1), the `snapshot.isNewSubAgentFlow`
    guard (1), and the `mainWorkflowSnapshot: null` reset (4).
- **Bugs filed**: **#1042** — both conversion directions are hand-written field
  lists instead of reuses of `deserializeWorkflow`/`serializeWorkflow`, so
  `parentId`, `style` and `Connection.condition` fall out. A group created
  inside a nested flow, its children's membership, and a branch condition are
  therefore destroyed by merely opening and closing the editor — the same class
  of defect as #1039, in a different function. Landed as three **passing**
  `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR (bug #1042)` cases per the #1031/#1039 precedent, so the
  suite is green today and goes red when the feature loop fixes it; those
  assertions must be **inverted**, not un-skipped.
- **Residual scope on #1041**: none — every case A1–F was implemented. Items the
  issue placed out of scope (dialog rendering, the overlap-avoidance geometry
  beyond one placement assertion) stay on manual E2E.

## 2026-07-26 — S6 (fifth slice): `setActiveWorkflow`, the canvas load conversion
- **Protects**: if this breaks, **every** way a workflow reaches the canvas —
  opening a `workflow.json`, an MCP `apply_workflow`, the Slack import, the
  sample load — silently installs something different from the file, and the
  next save writes that difference back. `setActiveWorkflow` is the **last
  writer** of `nodes`/`edges` on all four paths, so whatever it drops is what
  the user loses.
- **Issue/PR**: #1038 / PR from `claude/qa-set-active-workflow-load`
- **Outcome**: done — 13 passing cases in a new sibling suite,
  `packages/vscode/src/webview/src/stores/workflow-store-load.test.ts`.
  **No product source changed.** Notes:
  - No new infrastructure: fourth store suite under the webview
    `vitest.config.ts` that landed with #1014. `setActiveWorkflow`'s conversion
    had **no coverage at all** before this — `workflow-store-history.test.ts:355-397`
    drives the action but only to assert the `clearHistory` option, never the
    nodes and edges it produces. That option is deliberately **not** re-tested
    here; a second assertion on it would be negative value.
  - **Section A** (8 cases) pins the conversion contract field by field, because
    this is one of three near-identical `Workflow → canvas` converters
    (`:871`, `:921`, `:964`) that have **already drifted** — `:882`/`:932` run
    `normalizeMcpNodeData`, `:974` does not. `zIndex`, `parentId` and `style`
    are asserted as **key absence** (`'zIndex' in node`), not as `undefined`:
    a blanket spread would satisfy a presence-only check while burying ordinary
    nodes under the edge SVG layer.
  - A4 pins, **as observed**, that `sortNodesParentFirst` partitions on "is some
    node's parent" and not "is a group" — a childless group is *not* hoisted.
    One fixture asserts both halves (a group declared last is hoisted; a
    childless group declared earlier stays put), so neither can pass alone.
    #1033 pinned the same function through `onNodeDragStop`; this is a different
    call site, so the ordering is asserted, not the function.
  - **Section B** (4 cases) drives `deserializeWorkflow` → `setCanvas` →
    `setActiveWorkflow` exactly as the five call sites do (`Toolbar.tsx:340-356`,
    `App.tsx:451`/`:480`/`:616`/`:321`), asserting the state after **both** steps
    in one test so the overwrite itself is the assertion.
  - The load-order premise was **confirmed by running it**, not only by reading:
    `setActiveWorkflow` re-converts from the raw `Workflow` and its conversion is
    strictly weaker than `deserializeWorkflow`'s, so it destroys a connection's
    `condition` (`serializeWorkflow` reads `edge.data?.condition`), the backfilled
    `askUserQuestion` option ids, and an `ifElse`'s branch repair. Open a file
    with conditional routes, press save with **no edit**, and the conditions are
    gone from disk.
  - Those three landed **passing against the current (wrong) behaviour** and
    named `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR (bug #1039)` per the #1031 precedent, rather than
    skipped — the suite stays green and goes red the moment the feature loop
    fixes it, which is the intended signal.
  - B4 pins the MCP-normalization drift by driving `addGeneratedWorkflow` and
    `setActiveWorkflow` **on the same fixture in one test**, so the asymmetry is
    the thing under test. No bug filed for it: it is the store-side half of
    #1025's premise, per that issue.
  - A8 pins, as observed and **not** as desired, that `selectedNodeId` is left
    pointing at a node the new workflow does not contain. Not obviously wrong,
    but nothing else recorded it.
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating and reverting all five things the
    issue names — the `zIndex` spread (`:978`), the `sortNodesParentFirst` call
    (`:966`), `subAgentFlows || []` (`:998`), the `isTourActive: false` reset
    (`:1000`), and the edge literal (`:983-989`, mutated twice: port defaulting,
    and adding the `data` key) — each producing **exactly one named** failure.
    The last of those is the important one: it confirms B1 goes red when #1039
    is fixed.
  - One trap worth recording: `packages/*/src` written inside a `/** */` header
    comment **closes the comment** at the `*/`, and tsc then reports a cascade of
    parse errors ~20 lines later. Say "product source" in block comments.
- **Bugs filed**: **#1039** — one issue for the B1–B3 family, since they share a
  single root cause (`setActiveWorkflow` re-converting from the raw `Workflow`
  instead of reusing `deserializeWorkflow`'s output). The fix touches
  `packages/vscode/src/webview/src`, which this loop must not edit.
- **Out of scope, per the issue**: `updateWorkflow` (`:921`, only reachable from
  the **frozen** chat-UI refinement path); `addGeneratedWorkflow` (`:871`) beyond
  the one B4 comparison (it has no live webview caller today); whether any of
  this **renders** correctly (manual E2E, per §5); and the nested-group ordering
  flaw already recorded in #1015.

## 2026-07-26 — S4 (second slice): the `ccwf validate` / `ccwf render` contract
- **Protects**: if this breaks, a CI pipeline running `ccwf validate
  workflow.json` **goes green on a workflow that does not validate** — the
  build reports success, the broken workflow ships, and the failure surfaces
  wherever the agent is later run. The exit code is the entire machine-readable
  surface of that command; nothing else about the run is inspectable.
- **Issue/PR**: #1036 / PR from `claude/qa-cli-validate-render-contract`
- **Outcome**: done — 22 passing cases (the issue's 14, with the `md`-bundle
  equivalence and the two name-fallback shapes split out) across two new
  suites, `packages/cli/src/commands/validate.test.ts` (13) and
  `render.test.ts` (9). **No product source changed.** Notes:
  - No new infrastructure: third and fourth suites under the `packages/cli`
    `vitest.config.ts` that landed with #1008. Both commands were entirely
    untested before this — `load-workflow.test.ts` asserts that
    `WorkflowLoadError` is *constructed* with `exitCode === 2`, which is a
    different function from the two `catch` blocks that must **map it** to
    `process.exit(2)` rather than let it escape to `cli.ts:53`'s generic
    handler (which exits **1**, making a broken file indistinguishable from a
    failed validation). Those blocks are what section D/E pin.
  - Neither action closure is exported, so every case drives the command
    through a fresh `new Command()` with `parseAsync(..., { from: 'user' })`.
    `process.exit` is stubbed to **throw**, not no-op — the trap recorded for
    #1006/#1008 — and the helper reports the recorded code, so `render`'s
    success paths (which never exit) are distinguishable as `undefined`.
  - **stdout and stderr are captured separately**, because which stream a line
    lands on is half the contract: `ccwf validate x.json > out.txt` in CI
    captures the success line but not the error list, so a regression moving
    the `✗` block to stdout is user-visible and would pass a combined-output
    assertion. Every case asserts the *other* stream is empty.
  - The load-bearing case is C4: `--json` on an invalid workflow still exits 1,
    with the parsed payload and the exit code asserted **in one case** so
    neither half can pass alone. C5 pins that the `if / else if / else` chain
    keeps the JSON and human-readable reports mutually exclusive.
  - A2 asserts the header's `N` equals the number of `  - [` lines actually
    printed — the count comes from `result.errors.length` and the lines from a
    separate loop, so "says 3, prints 2" is exactly the silent case.
  - Render's two formats **share a prefix**, so `--format mermaid` is asserted
    by **equality** against the generator's block plus one newline, *and* by
    the explicit absence of `## Workflow Execution Guide`. A bare
    `toContain('```mermaid')` passes on the `md` bundle too and would have
    succeeded for the wrong reason (the trap recorded for #1024). Section order
    is asserted by `indexOf` comparison, not presence, so a reordering
    regression fails.
  - **F** pins, as **observed and explicitly not desired**, that a JSON file
    which parses but is not a workflow kills `render` with a raw `TypeError`
    from `nodes.filter` — while `validate` handles the identical input
    gracefully. Per the issue, **no bug filed**: #1008 already flagged the same
    shape on the `export` path and left it as a feature-track question.
  - Verified the suites bite by hand-mutating and reverting exactly the five
    things the issue names: the `result.valid ? 0 : 1` ternary (4 named
    failures), the `else if (result.valid)` arm (4), the `error.exitCode` in
    the `catch` (2), the early `return` in the mermaid branch (2), and the
    `workflow.name || 'Workflow'` fallback (2). Each made a **named**
    assertion fail.
- **Bugs filed**: none — all 14 cases landed passing, as the issue predicted.
- **Out of scope, per the issue**: what `render` *prints* (the generators are
  #995 / #1024's subject); `ccwf run`'s `NEXT_STEP_HINTS` and `--launch`
  spawn; and `validate`'s multi-file discovery and `--strict`, which are
  `auto-dev` features not yet on `main`.

## 2026-07-26 — S6 (fourth slice): group membership on node drag-stop
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user drags a node into a group and the
  canvas draws it inside, but `parentId` is never set — or is set to the wrong
  group — so the saved `workflow.json`, the Mermaid `subgraph` blocks, and the
  Group Node Execution Tracking table all describe **a different structure than
  the canvas shows**. Nothing on the user's machine reports it; the divergence
  surfaces wherever the agent is later run.
- **Issue/PR**: #1033 / PR from `claude/qa-drag-group-membership`
- **Outcome**: done — 26 passing cases (the issue's 14, expanded by `it.each`
  over the hit-test edges and the three size-source shapes) in a new
  `packages/vscode/src/webview/src/stores/workflow-store-groups.test.ts`.
  **No product source changed.** Notes on what the cases pin:
  - No new infrastructure: third store suite under the webview
    `vitest.config.ts` that landed with #1014. `workflow-store.ts` imports
    `@cc-wf-studio/core` through its `dist`, so `pnpm build` must precede
    `pnpm test` on a fresh checkout (already recorded under #1020).
  - `onNodeDragStop` is the **only** writer of `parentId` from canvas
    interaction and had **no** test before this. `workflow-store-history.test.ts`
    section E reproduces the pause/resume half of the drag contract by writing
    positions with `setState` and never invokes the action, so the group logic
    was entirely untouched.
  - Fixtures are installed with `setState`, not `setCanvas` — the one departure
    from the sibling suites' "drive everything through public actions" rule,
    and documented in the file header. `setCanvas` applies
    `sortNodesParentFirst` itself (`workflow-store.ts:966`), and array order is
    under test in sections A3/D12/E, so letting a second call site rewrite the
    fixture would have tested the wrong function.
  - **Section A** asserts the four early returns by **array identity**
    (`toBe`), not value equality: every `set()` this action skips is also an
    undo entry `handleNodeDragStop` (`WorkflowEditor.tsx:284`) would otherwise
    record, so "wrote nothing" is the actual contract.
  - **B/C** assert `parentId` **and** `position` together — a case checking
    only `parentId` still passes while the node renders 100px off its drop
    point. B6 covers group→group, where the conversion runs twice and a sign
    error hides. C9 pins that `parentId` is written as `undefined` rather than
    the key being deleted; the two are indistinguishable today because
    `serializeWorkflow` spreads `...(node.parentId && { parentId })`, but
    pinning what is written keeps the two modules in step.
  - **D** gives each of the four inclusive edges, both corners and all four
    one-pixel misses its own named case, since `>=` vs `>` is a one-character
    regression. D12 pins the overlapping-group winner as **observed**: the loop
    `break`s on the first match in **array order, not z-index** — not what a
    user would predict, and a refactor dropping the `break` changes it
    silently.
  - **E14** pins the other observed-not-designed behaviour:
    `sortNodesParentFirst` partitions on "is some node's parent", not "is a
    group" (`:190`), so a group that loses its last child leaves the `parents`
    partition and is reordered behind a still-parent group — an **untouched**
    node moving, which is exactly what a rewrite would change without noticing.
    It takes two groups to observe; with one, the partition change is invisible
    in the output order.
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating and reverting exactly the five
    things the issue names: the `targetGroup.id !== currentParentId` guard (1
    named failure), the `>=` on the hit test's left edge (2), the `?? 400`
    width fallback (1 — correctly only the no-size-at-all case, since the
    React-Flow-`width` shape never reaches the fallback), the subtraction in
    the move-in conversion (2), and the `[...parents, ...others]` order (2).
    Each made a **named** assertion fail.
- **Bugs filed**: none — all 14 cases landed passing, as the issue predicted.
- **Out of scope, per the issue**: the nested-ordering flaw in
  `sortNodesParentFirst` is already recorded in **#1015** and is unreachable
  through this action anyway (line 590 returns before a group can nest). The
  other three `sortNodesParentFirst` call sites (`:873`, `:923`, `:966` —
  `addGeneratedWorkflow` / `updateWorkflow` / `setCanvas`) are a separate slice
  and #1033 stays closed on this one; whether the drag *renders* correctly
  stays on manual E2E per `docs/quality/03-assurance-map.md` §5.

## 2026-07-26 — S7: the agent `.md` frontmatter parser behind sub-agent import
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user picks an existing `.claude/agents/*.md`
  from the Sub-Agent creation dialog and the node that lands on the canvas
  carries the **wrong model, the wrong tools, and an `agentDefinition` that
  still has the raw `---` block inside it** — so every artifact generated from
  that workflow describes a different agent than the file they chose, and the
  divergence surfaces wherever the agent is later run.
- **Issue/PR**: #1030 / PR from `claude/qa-agent-frontmatter`
- **Outcome**: done — 17 passing cases in a new
  `packages/vscode/src/webview/src/utils/agent-frontmatter.test.ts`.
  **No product source changed.** Notes on what the cases pin:
  - No new infrastructure: the module has zero imports, so it runs under the
    webview `vitest.config.ts` that landed with #1014, next to
    `workflow-diff.test.ts`. Section F imports `@cc-wf-studio/core` through its
    `dist`, so `pnpm build` must precede `pnpm test` on a fresh checkout
    (already recorded under #1020).
  - Both call sites (`SubAgentCreationDialog.tsx:125`, `NodePalette.tsx:207`)
    parse the **same content independently** and both fall back on a falsy
    value (`|| 'sonnet'`, `|| ''`), so a failed parse never fails loudly. That
    is why the empty-value case pins `''` rather than `undefined`: today both
    take the same branch, and a change there changes which one runs.
  - Nested-structure cases assert with `toEqual` on the **whole** frontmatter
    object, because an inner line of a `hooks:` block leaking to the top level
    — a nested config silently becoming agent metadata — is the failure the
    code comment's "skip complex nested structures" claim is about.
  - Section F is a **contract between two independently maintained modules**:
    `generateSubAgentFile` writes the file, `parseAgentFrontmatter` reads it
    back. It is the only part of the suite that is not a check of the parser
    against its own regex.
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating four things and reverting each:
    the non-greedy `*?`, the `\n?` after the closing fence, the `[\w-]` in the
    key pattern, and the `.trim()` on the body. Each made exactly one **named**
    assertion fail.
- **Bugs filed**: **#1031** — the fence pattern hardcodes `\n`, so a **CRLF**
  agent file does not match at all: `model` falls back to `sonnet` whatever the
  file said, `tools` and `memory` are dropped, and `agentDefinition` becomes the
  whole file including the raw fences. Reachable on Windows, where the
  extension ships. Per the issue, the case is landed **passing against the
  current (wrong) behaviour** and named `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR (bug #1031)` rather
  than skipped — so it goes red when the feature loop fixes it, which is the
  intended signal to update it.
- **Second finding, not filed separately**: `generateSubAgentFile` interpolates
  `description: ${data.description || name}` with no `escapeYamlString`, unlike
  the slash-command path in the same file. A description containing a newline
  therefore **injects extra frontmatter lines** (`description: line one\nmodel:
  haiku`) and does not survive the round trip — the parsed description is
  `'line one'`. This is the same family as the already-filed **#1009**, so per
  #1030's own instruction it is recorded here rather than filed a second time
  in one run. Pinned as observed in section F.

## 2026-07-26 — S1 (behavior half): the cross-field derive normalizers
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user edits one field of a branching node in
  the property panel and a **different** field is silently rewritten — a Switch
  node's default case stops sorting last, so the exported instructions tell the
  agent to evaluate the fallback ahead of the specific conditions it was meant
  to follow; or toggling AI suggestions off on an AskUserQuestion node wipes the
  options the user typed. Nothing reports it: the panel shows the value that was
  written, and the divergence surfaces wherever the agent later runs.
- **Issue/PR**: #1028 / PR from `claude/qa-derive-normalizers`
- **Outcome**: done — 24 passing cases in a new
  `packages/core/src/schema/nodes/derive-updates.test.ts`, one `describe` per
  function, all driven through the `@cc-wf-studio/core` schema entry point.
  **No product source changed.** Notes on what the cases pin:
  - These four functions are **not** a declarative schema, so covering them is
    an inspection rather than a transcription: `.claude/rules/schema-driven-panels.md`
    deliberately keeps cross-field effects out of `FieldMeta` ("No side-effect
    meta") and puts them in hand-written pure functions co-located with the
    schema. They implement rules stated nowhere else.
  - Every patch is a **single key**, matching what the call site actually
    produces (`SchemaPropertyPanel.tsx:74-76` builds `{ [fieldName]: value }`).
  - Assertions are `toEqual` on the **whole** returned object, because the
    failure mode is a dropped or extra key — a case checking one field in
    isolation still passes once the function starts adding keys it shouldn't.
    The pass-through cases additionally assert the *absence* of `outputPorts`.
  - **`deriveSwitchUpdate`**: default-last ordering with the regular cases'
    relative order preserved, two defaults keeping their own order, no-default
    left untouched, the `outputPorts` sync, pass-through, the `Array.isArray`
    guard (`switch-schema.ts:66` — without it `.filter` throws a TypeError
    inside the panel's change handler), and **purity** (the caller's array must
    not be sorted in place).
  - **`deriveAskUserQuestionUpdate`**: enabling AI suggestions clears options;
    **disabling preserves them** — the doc comment calls out that disabling does
    not restore defaults, and a regression that clears here instead is the
    silent-data-loss case this suite exists for. Plus both `multiSelect` arms,
    the option count read **from `data`, not the patch**, the absent-`options`
    paths, and arm **precedence** (`useAiSuggestions` wins over a same-patch
    `options`) pinned as observed so reordering the arms fails by name.
  - **`deriveBranchUpdate`** (legacy): the >2 → first-two trim pinned as
    observed (it discards the user's 3rd+ branches; the doc comment states this
    is deliberate), the exactly-two no-op, `switch` not trimming, the count
    sync, and the absent-`data.branches` path.
  - **`deriveIfElseUpdate`**: `outputPorts: 2` regardless of array length —
    enforcing `.length(2)` is the zod schema's job, not this function's.
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating and reverting exactly the five
    things the issue names: the `[...regular, ...defaults]` concatenation order
    (2 named failures), the `Array.isArray` guard (1), the `enabled ? [] :
    options` ternary (3), `data.options` → `patch.options` in the `multiSelect`
    arm (1), and `branches.length > 2` (1). Each made a **named** assertion fail.
- **Bugs filed**: none — all four functions behave as their doc comments state.
- **Out of scope, per the issue**: `NODE_DERIVE_FNS`
  (`node-schema-registry.ts:65`) has **no consumers** — the panels import each
  derive function directly rather than looking it up. A "registry agrees with
  the panel configs" test would either assert dead code or import the webview's
  React panel modules. If that panel/registry drift is worth closing, it is a
  feature-track question, not a test.

## 2026-07-25 — S2 (fourth slice): the MCP tool node execution instructions
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user configures an MCP node in the canvas
  and the exported skill / slash command / `ccwf render` output describes a
  **different tool call than the one they configured** — the wrong server, a
  dropped parameter, a lost constraint, or the wrong execution strategy
  entirely (telling the agent to call a fixed tool when the user asked the AI
  to pick one). Nothing on the user's machine reports it; the damage happens
  wherever the agent later runs. `docs/quality/02-feature-map.md` rates the
  MCP node **A** with exactly this failure.
- **Issue/PR**: #1024 / PR from `claude/qa-mcp-execution-instructions`
- **Outcome**: done — 31 passing cases and 2 deliberately skipped, appended as
  a `describe` block to the existing
  `packages/core/src/services/workflow-prompt-generator.test.ts` so the
  `mcpNode` fixture and `makeWorkflow` helper are shared. All three formatters
  are module-private, so every case drives them through the exported
  `generateExecutionInstructions`; **no product source changed**. Sections:
  - **A. Mode dispatch** — the load-bearing half, since picking the wrong
    formatter changes the execution strategy the agent is told to use. All
    three modes, plus both fallbacks (`mode` absent — the shape every
    pre-mode workflow file on disk has — and an unrecognised string).
    Each dispatch case matches the **whole heading line**: the manual heading
    is a prefix of the AI Parameter Config heading, so a `toContain` on it
    would pass on AI-mode output and the case would succeed for the wrong
    reason.
  - **B. Manual parameter config** — typed rendering of configured values, an
    untyped value with no matching schema entry (a dropped parameter here is
    the A-rated failure), `JSON.stringify` for object/array values rather
    than `[object Object]`, both empty-section guards, required/optional
    labels with the description fallback, the `MCP Tool` / empty-string
    placeholders instead of printing `undefined`, and server + validation
    status.
  - **C. AI parameter config** — the metadata comment is extracted and
    `JSON.parse`d rather than string-matched: it is a machine-readable
    contract with the consuming agent and nothing in the repo parses it
    today, so a malformed payload is otherwise invisible. Plus
    `parameterSchema` mirroring in order, and **constraint rendering
    parameterised over all six `validation` keys** — one case per key, so
    dropping any single clause fails a case that names the missing
    constraint.
  - **D. AI tool selection** — metadata carries the server and intent and
    **nothing else** (`toEqual`, not `toMatchObject`, so a leaked `toolName`
    fails), the server id embedded verbatim in the execution sentence, and
    the case that matters most: a `toolName`/`parameters` left over on the
    node data from a previous manual configuration must **not** be emitted,
    or the agent is told to call that specific tool in the mode that exists
    to let it choose one.
  - **E. Provider dependence** — `getAgentName` per provider including
    `roo-code` → **Zoo Code** (the #801 rename is exactly the kind of thing
    that regresses back), and the manual mode asserted provider-**independent**
    by comparing two providers' output directly.
  - **F.** Two nodes in different modes, each with its own subsection in
    workflow node order under a single `## MCP Tool Nodes` heading.
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating and reverting the five things
    the issue names — the `default:` arm of the mode switch (2 named
    failures), the `paramSchema` type annotation (1), the
    `Object.keys(parameterValues).length > 0` guard (1), the `maxLength`
    constraint clause (1), and `getAgentName`'s `roo-code` arm (1). Each made
    a **named** assertion fail.
- **Bugs filed**: **#1025** and **#1026** — both found by this suite, both
  verified in the code before filing:
  - **#1025 — legacy `mode` values export as manual parameter config.**
    `normalizeMcpNodeData` (`types/mcp-node.ts:261`) exists to migrate the v1
    names, but its only two callers are `addGeneratedWorkflow` /
    `updateWorkflow` in the webview store. Nothing in `deserializeWorkflow`,
    `packages/cli` or `packages/mcp` calls it, so a file on disk carrying
    `mode: 'fullNaturalLanguage'` misses all three `case` arms and is exported
    as manual config — the wrong execution strategy, silently. Per the #1018
    precedent this is **pinned as observed in a passing case named after the
    issue**, not skipped; the case says to update it once the fix lands.
  - **#1026 — user-typed text breaks the exported markup.** `JSON.stringify`
    does not escape `>`, so a `-->` in the free-text description ends the
    `MCP_NODE_METADATA` comment mid-JSON and the remainder leaks into the
    document as visible text. Same root cause: the User Intent block opens
    with three backticks, so a description containing its own fence closes it
    early and the intended closing fence opens a new one that swallows
    `**Execution Method**` — `workflow-overview-formatter` already uses four
    backticks for exactly this reason. Both cases **land skipped**, asserting
    the intended contract, so they un-skip unchanged once #1026 is fixed.
- **Residual scope on #1024**: none — all 27 cases the issue names landed,
  which completes the MCP slice of S2. #995's item 3 (Claude Code artifacts
  vs `spec.md`) remains blocked on a human revising that spec, unchanged by
  this PR. The `export-metadata.schema.json` contract the issue calls out as
  a trap was deliberately **not** tested against: it is written to the v1
  mode names, requires an `instructions` key the generator never emits, and
  types `parameterSchema` as an object where the generator emits an array.

## 2026-07-25 — S6 (third slice): undo/redo history in the canvas store
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user presses Ctrl+Z after an AI agent's
  `apply_workflow` rewrote their canvas and their work does not come back —
  undo is the canvas's only recovery path, and most edits carry no
  confirmation. In the other direction, a regressed `clear()` makes Ctrl+Z on
  a freshly opened workflow pull in the *previous* workflow's nodes, which the
  next save then writes into the wrong file.
- **Issue/PR**: #1022 / PR from `claude/qa-canvas-undo-redo-history`
- **Outcome**: done — 18 passing cases in a new sibling suite,
  `packages/vscode/src/webview/src/stores/workflow-store-history.test.ts`,
  covering all 17 cases the issue names, driven through the store's public
  actions and `useWorkflowStore.temporal.getState()`. A **sibling file** rather
  than an addition to `workflow-store.test.ts` on purpose: vitest gives each
  file its own module registry, so the module-global temporal stack here cannot
  perturb that file's module-global revision counter. No new test
  infrastructure — the `localStorage` setup file that landed with #1020 was
  the only thing needed. Sections:
  - **A. What is and is not an undoable step** — `addNode`, `onConnect`
    (exactly one entry, though it rewrites every node with `selected: false`)
    and `updateNodeData` each record one, and `undo()` restores the prior
    value; selection and React Flow `dimensions` changes record **none** (the
    load-bearing half — without both the `partialize` strip and the `equality`
    dedupe, the user's real edit sits further from Ctrl+Z than it looks); and
    `setCanvas` with identical content in fresh arrays records none, since
    `equality` compares content, not array identity. Each "records nothing"
    case first asserts the change actually landed, so the zero cannot pass
    vacuously.
  - **B. Redo** — `undo()` → `redo()` round-trips and drains `futureStates`;
    a fresh edit after an `undo()` drops the redo stack, which is what disables
    the button at `UndoRedoControls.tsx:24`.
  - **C. The 50-entry cap** — 60 distinct changes leave `pastStates.length`
    at 50, and 50 undos land on `v10`, not the `v0` the canvas started from.
    Asserting the exact label is what distinguishes "the oldest were dropped"
    from "the newest were".
  - **D. History clearing** — all five `clear()` sites: `clearWorkflow`,
    `addGeneratedWorkflow`, `setActiveWorkflow` by default,
    `setActiveSubAgentFlowId` on entering sub-agent flow editing, and
    `cancelSubAgentFlowEditing` with a snapshot — plus its early return, so a
    stray Escape on the main canvas does not cost the undo stack. **And the
    case the issue exists for**: `setActiveWorkflow(w, { clearHistory: false })`
    preserves history, reproducing `App.tsx:317-321` verbatim
    (`deserializeWorkflow` → `setCanvas` → `setWorkflowName` →
    `setActiveWorkflow`) and asserting the pre-apply canvas comes back on a
    single `undo()`. The count is pinned at exactly 1, so the user's work
    cannot end up buried behind no-op entries from the pair writing the same
    content twice.
  - **E. The drag pause/resume contract** — reproduces
    `WorkflowEditor.tsx:279-301`'s exact sequence (pause, four per-mouse-move
    position writes, revert to pre-drag, resume, apply final) and asserts it
    yields exactly one entry that undoes to the pre-drag position. The
    component's single-entry-per-drag trick is a contract with zundo's
    `pause`/`resume`, so a zundo upgrade could silently turn one drag into zero
    entries or one per mouse-move and nothing else would notice.
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating and reverting five things — the
    four the issue names plus one more: dropping `selected` from the
    `partialize` strip (2 named failures), replacing `equality` with
    `() => false` (4), making the `options?.clearHistory !== false` guard
    unconditional (1), lowering `limit` to 20 (1), and neutering the `clear()`
    in `clearWorkflow` and `cancelSubAgentFlowEditing` (2).
- **Case 7 (`partialize`'d fields on restore), resolved as observed**: what
  `undo()` hands back carries no `selected` / `width` / `height` key, since
  `partialize` strips them before the entry is stored. Asserted as observed and
  **not** filed as a bug: React Flow re-measures on the next render and
  re-applies selection from its own state, so the missing keys are not known to
  be user-visible. The case says so in place and tells whoever proves otherwise
  to file a `bug` and update it rather than assert a different answer.
- **Bugs filed**: none — every clear site, the `clearHistory` guard, the cap
  and the dedupe behave as the code claims.
- **Residual scope on #1022**: none — all 17 cases landed, which closes S6.
  `updateWorkflow` (`workflow-store.ts:921`) remains deliberately uncovered per
  the issue: its only callers are the frozen chat-UI refinement path.
- **Noted, not acted on**: `tsc` in the webview build compiles this test file
  (it surfaced an unused-import error before vitest ever ran). That is the same
  packaging shape #1011 describes for `core`/`mcp`/`cli`; the webview is not
  published, so it costs only build time. Left for #1011 rather than widened
  here.

## 2026-07-25 — S6 (second slice): the canvas change-detection gate
- **Protects**: if this breaks, an external AI agent's `apply_workflow`
  overwrites the edits a user made *after* the agent fetched the workflow and
  nothing tells them — or, in the other direction, every apply carrying an
  `expectedRevision` is rejected and MCP-driven editing silently stops working.
- **Issue/PR**: #1020 / PR from `claude/qa-canvas-change-detection`
- **Outcome**: done — 25 passing cases in
  `packages/vscode/src/webview/src/stores/workflow-store.test.ts`, covering all
  23 cases the issue names, driven entirely through the store's public actions:
  - **A. The revision increments on content changes** — `addNode`,
    `confirmDeleteNodes`, `onConnect`, `updateNodeData`, a `position` change,
    and `setCanvas` with different content. `onConnect` gets its own case
    because it also rewrites every node with `selected: false`, so the correct
    answer is exactly 1, not 2.
  - **B. The revision ignores noise** — the load-bearing half, since a false
    increment kills every `apply_workflow` that carries an `expectedRevision`:
    `select` changes, `setCanvas` with fresh array identities but identical
    content (the fingerprint comparison, not the reference fast path, is what
    has to hold), a **staged** delete before `confirmDeleteNodes`, and
    unrelated store fields (`setWorkflowName`, `setSelectedNodeId`).
  - **C / D. `hasUnsavedChanges`** — the pristine-canvas heuristic with no
    `activeWorkflow` (boot state, extra node, edge present, renamed, two nodes
    that are not start+end), and the field-by-field comparison against a loaded
    workflow (node/edge count, name, an id the saved workflow lacks, a moved
    node, edited data, a rewired edge).
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating and reverting the four things the
    issue names: dropping the `selected`/`width`/`height` strip in
    `contentFingerprint` (2 named failures), inverting the reference fast path
    (6), removing the node-position clause of the `activeWorkflow` comparison
    (1), and neutering the `nodes.length !== 2` pristine check (1).
- **Test infrastructure** (both questions the issue flagged, answered):
  - **`localStorage` stub** — needed, and it must be a `setupFiles` entry:
    the store reads `localStorage` while `create()` runs, i.e. at import time,
    so a per-test `vi.stubGlobal` is too late. Landed as
    `src/test/setup-browser-globals.ts` (in-memory `Storage`, also stubs
    `sessionStorage`), wired into the webview `vitest.config.ts` so every
    future store suite inherits it.
  - **`reactflow` under `environment: 'node'`** — works, no DOM needed. The
    store imports `applyNodeChanges` / `applyEdgeChanges` / `addEdge` from the
    `reactflow` barrel and they import cleanly, so **no `jsdom` devDependency
    was added and the shared node environment was left alone**. `@shared` is
    imported type-only and erases, so no alias config was needed either.
  - Note for future suites: `pnpm build` must run before the webview tests on a
    fresh checkout — they resolve `@cc-wf-studio/core` through its `dist`.
- **Case 11 (`dimensions`), resolved empirically**: React Flow v11 writes only
  `width` / `height` for that change type, both of which `contentFingerprint`
  strips, so the delta is **+0** — no over-report and no bug. The case asserts
  the node's key set alongside the delta, so if a future React Flow writes the
  measurement to a field the fingerprint does not strip, the test fails and
  says which field rather than passing for the wrong reason.
- **Bugs filed**: none new. Case 23 (the port-default disagreement at
  `workflow-store.ts:1503`) is asserted **as observed** and recorded as a third
  instance of **#1018** rather than a new issue, per that issue's own guidance.
  It is reachable: a workflow whose connection omits `fromPort` loads with
  `sourceHandle: undefined`, which `hasUnsavedChanges` reads back as
  `'default'` and compares against the saved `undefined` — so an
  agent-authored workflow reports unsaved changes the moment it loads, and the
  next sample-workflow load prompts the user to discard edits they never made.
  Severity is a spurious dialog, not data loss. Commented on #1018.
- **Residual scope on #1020**: none — sections A-D all landed. The undo/redo
  half of S6 (`partialize` / `equality` / `limit: 50` and the history clears in
  `clearWorkflow` / `setActiveWorkflow`) is explicitly out of scope in the
  issue and still wants its own issue; the `localStorage` setup file landed
  here unblocks it.

## 2026-07-25 — S6 (first slice): the MCP apply_workflow review gate
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user approves an AI's rewrite of their
  canvas from a summary that does not match what is about to be written — a
  removed node missing from the list, or "no changes" shown for an apply that
  replaces three nodes. `computeWorkflowDiff` is the only thing that describes
  an incoming `apply_workflow` before it lands.
- **Issue/PR**: #1017 / PR from `claude/qa-workflow-diff-review-gate`
- **Outcome**: done — 25 passing cases in
  `packages/vscode/src/webview/src/utils/workflow-diff.test.ts`, covering the
  issue's 16 named cases. No new config: the module's only imports are
  `import type`, so it runs under the webview `vitest.config.ts` that landed
  with #1014 with no alias resolution, no DOM, no React. Sections:
  - **A. Node classification** — added / removed / modified asserted as the
    **whole three lists**, so a node landing in two categories fails; an
    unchanged node absent from all three; the `data.description || node.id`
    name fallback asserted on **both** sides, because it is written twice
    (`getNodeName` for canvas nodes, an inline expression for incoming ones)
    and a refactor may update only one; and the deliberate asymmetry where a
    typeless removed node reads `'unknown'` while a typeless added node passes
    `undefined` straight through.
  - **B. Connection counting** — matching sets count zero; a genuine add and a
    genuine remove count once each; duplicate parallel wires collapse to one
    key because both sides are `Set`s.
  - **C. `isNewWorkflow`** — the flag that switches the dialog heading
    (`DiffPreviewDialog.tsx:89`): true for an empty canvas and for the default
    start + end, but **false once the user has wired start → end**, since any
    edge at all disqualifies it.
  - **D. `totalChanges` / `nameChange`** — parameterised one scenario per term
    of the sum, so dropping any single term fails a case that names the missing
    term; plus the all-categories sum, the no-op apply (`totalChanges === 0` is
    what `DiffPreviewDialog.tsx:144` keys its "no changes" message off), and
    `nameChange` null versus `{ from, to }`.
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating the four things the issue names
    and reverting each: dropping the `nameChange` term from `totalChanges`
    (2 named failures), inverting the `currentEdgeKeys.has` check (8),
    removing the `|| 'unknown'` type fallback (1), and relaxing
    `isNewWorkflow`'s `currentEdges.length === 0` clause (1).
- **Bugs filed**: #1018 — the diff compares serialized form rather than
  meaning, in two places, and both make the dialog **overstate** an incoming
  apply. (a) The two edge-key builders disagree on the port default
  (`sourceHandle ?? ''` vs `fromPort` verbatim, while `serializeWorkflow`
  normalizes null to `'output'`/`'input'`), so one unchanged wire counts as
  1 added + 1 removed. This is not just the null case: handle ids differ per
  node component (`StartNode` emits `out`, `SubAgentNode` emits
  `input`/`output`) while the authoring guide tells agents to write
  `"fromPort": "output"`, so a `start → subAgent` wire — the most common in
  the product — diffs as a change on every apply. (b) `modifiedNodes`
  compares `JSON.stringify(data)`, so a different key order reads as modified,
  and an `askUserQuestion` node reads as modified whenever an agent omits the
  option ids that `ensureNodeDataItemIds` generates on load.
- **Judgment — asserted as observed, not skipped**: four cases pin (a) and (b)
  as the code behaves today and therefore pass. Skipping them would have left
  the module's most-used path uncovered while the feature track decides;
  instead the cases are named after the mismatch and #1018 asks whoever fixes
  it to update them rather than work around them. Nothing here is a data
  defect — the diff is a summary and the apply itself is unaffected — so the
  cost is trust in the review gate, not a corrupted file.
- **Residual scope on #1017**: none — all 16 cases landed. The store half of
  S6 (undo/redo, `clearWorkflow`, unsaved-change detection) was sliced out of
  #1017 on purpose and still wants its own issue: `workflow-store.ts` reads
  `localStorage` at store-creation time (lines 342–359) and needs a stub this
  module does not.

## 2026-07-25 — S3: the canvas serialization round-trip
- **Protects**: if this breaks, the user opens a workflow in the canvas,
  presses save, and the file comes back different from what they had — a
  group's children detach and render outside it, a branch edge loses the
  condition that routed it, or the slash-command `model` / `allowedTools`
  they configured silently disappear from `workflow.json`.
- **Issue/PR**: #1014 / PR from `claude/qa-canvas-serialization-round-trip`
- **Outcome**: done — the **first tests in the webview package**, 41 passing
  + 1 skipped in `src/services/workflow-service.test.ts`, plus a minimal
  `vitest.config.ts` (node environment, `src/**/*.{test,spec}.ts`) so the
  suite does not inherit the React plugin from `vite.config.ts`. Sections:
  - **A. `deserializeWorkflow`** — parent-first ordering when the file
    declares children before their group (the load-bearing case: AI-authored
    files and `patch_workflow` output have no reason to declare a group
    first); `parentId` / `style` present only when the source node has them;
    `connections` → `edges` renames with `data` set to `{ condition }` only
    when a condition exists; load-time id backfill for `askUserQuestion`
    options and `branch`/`switch` branches, including the **identity** case
    (unchanged data returns the same reference, which is what stops needless
    re-renders); and the `ifElse` repair — 0 or 1 branch padded to two with
    the English `True`/`False` fallbacks **and `outputPorts: 2`**, versus a
    well-formed node returned untouched *without* `outputPorts`.
  - **B. `serializeWorkflow`** — name falling back to the node id; `style`
    narrowed to `width`/`height` with the key omitted entirely when neither
    is set; edge handles defaulting to `output`/`input`; and the
    `slashCommandOptions` block parameterised over all six options, so
    dropping any single clause of `hasNonDefaultOptions` fails a named case.
    Also `tour` only when non-empty, and the pass-through payloads.
  - **C. Round-trip** — one fixture (group + two grouped children + an
    `askUserQuestion` with labelled option edges + an `ifElse`) asserted as
    **whole node and edge arrays**, so a dropped field fails rather than
    slipping between field-by-field checks; plus a second round-trip.
  - Verified the suite bites by hand-mutating five things and reverting each:
    removing the parent-first sort, dropping the `allowedTools` clause from
    `hasNonDefaultOptions`, setting `edge.data` unconditionally, copying
    `node.style` wholesale instead of narrowing it, and dropping the
    `outputPorts: 2` from the `ifElse` repair in core. Each made a named
    assertion fail (2–4 tests each).
- **Bugs filed**: #1015 — `deserializeWorkflow`'s sort comparator is correct
  pairwise but is **not a transitive ordering**, so a nested group can be
  emitted before the group that contains it (observed: parent at index 2,
  nested child at index 0). Section D of the issue landed as `it.skip`
  naming #1015. Reachable only from an AI-authored or hand-edited file — the
  canvas never creates nested groups (`workflow-store.ts:591`) — hence
  moderate, not high. The bug notes the second, independent implementation
  of the same invariant (`sortNodesParentFirst`, `workflow-store.ts:189`)
  for the same fix pass.
- **Deliberately not filed as a bug**: `serializeWorkflow` mints a fresh
  `id` and resets `createdAt` on every save (lines 87, 93–94). Per the
  issue, this was judged rather than assumed: nothing in the product reads
  either field back (`createdAt` is only ever written — `refinement-service`
  preserves it defensively, no UI or exporter reads it), so it is dead
  metadata, not a user-visible defect. The suite asserts the **observed**
  behaviour and says so, rather than claiming preservation.
- **Note for the next iteration**: `sortNodesParentFirst` and the rest of
  `workflow-store.ts` remain uncovered — that is S6 and wants its own issue.
  `validateWorkflow` in the same module stays out of scope as a
  transcription of S1's ground.

## 2026-07-25 — S4: the `ccwf export` write contract
- **Protects**: if this breaks, `ccwf export` (and `ccwf run`, which shares
  `runExport`) overwrites the user's hand-edited `.claude/agents/*.md` or
  `.claude/skills/<workflow>/SKILL.md` without asking — silently and
  irreversibly, while still printing `✓ Wrote N file(s)`.
- **Issue/PR**: #1008 / PR from `claude/qa-cli-export-write-contract`
- **Outcome**: done — the **first tests in `packages/cli`** (its vitest config
  existed but the suite was empty). Two suites, 21 tests:
  - `src/commands/export.test.ts` (sections A–D). Every case asserts the
    **complete set of files** found by walking a temp output root, not a series
    of `exists` checks, so a stray write fails the test. Section A: the
    claude-code plan materialised from an empty root, nested dirs created,
    `writtenPaths` absolute under a *resolved* `rootDir`, and — parameterised
    over all three markers (`commandFilePath`, `pluginName`, `builtInType`) —
    **no agent file for a sub-agent the user already maintains**. Section B,
    the load-bearing one: a pre-existing sentinel refuses with `process.exit(1)`
    and leaves the sentinel byte-for-byte intact **and the non-conflicting
    agent files uncreated**, because the sweep completes before the write loop
    starts; `--overwrite` writes everything; and conflict detection keys off
    `cwd`, not `process.cwd()`. Section C: plan selection (codex writes nothing
    under `.claude/`, cursor mirrors sub-agents) and the Claude Code-only
    warning in both directions. Section D: `asSupportedAgent` rejecting with
    commander's `InvalidArgumentError` naming every agent, and `runExport`
    propagating a `WorkflowLoadError` while **writing nothing**.
  - `src/utils/load-workflow.test.ts` (section D, the exit-code half): missing
    file and malformed JSON each become a `WorkflowLoadError` with
    `exitCode === 2`, and a relative path in produces an **absolute** path in
    the message — this module is the `<file>` error contract every subcommand
    shares, so a regression here turns a typo into a raw stack trace.
- **On stubbing `process.exit`**: mocked to *throw*, per the issue. A no-op
  mock lets execution fall through into the write loop, so the conflict tests
  would have asserted the opposite of what really happens; the assertion is on
  the recorded call argument, not the thrown message.
- **Verified the suites bite** by hand-mutating six things and restoring each:
  the `!options.overwrite` conflict condition (1 test), the plan-selection
  ternary (13), `resolvePlanned` regressed to a cwd-relative `path.resolve`
  (1), the Claude Code-only warning (1), core's `commandFilePath` skip (1), and
  `path.resolve` in `loadWorkflowFromFile` (1). Each made a named assertion
  fail. The cwd-relative mutation was exercised only under the test that
  `chdir`s into a temp dir, so no mutation run could write into the repo.
- **Bugs filed**: none — the write path behaved as specified in every case.
  The two product-behaviour oddities #1008 flagged (a JSON file that parses but
  is not a workflow crashes with a `TypeError` stack trace; two sub-agent names
  that normalise to the same file name silently collide) are **still not
  filed** — the issue deliberately left them unasserted as feature-track
  questions, and this loop files at most one issue per run.
- **Residual scope on #1008**: none — all 14 named cases landed. The issue's
  own out-of-scope list (multi-agent atomicity, dry-run/JSON output, the
  `{meta, workflow}` wrapper, `--launch`) stays with `auto-dev`.

## 2026-07-25 — S5 (write half): the MCP write path and optimistic locking
- **Protects**: if this breaks, an external AI agent's `apply_workflow` /
  `update_nodes` call silently overwrites or corrupts the user's
  `workflow.json` — the only path in the product where an outside agent writes
  to the user's file — and nothing tells them until they reopen the canvas and
  find their edits gone.
- **Issue/PR**: #1006 / PR from `claude/qa-mcp-write-path`
- **Outcome**: done — two suites in `packages/mcp/src/`, plus shared fixtures
  in `__fixtures__/workflows.ts` (26 tests):
  - `file-adapter.test.ts` (section A): the four locking states — matching
    revision writes and reports the *new* hash, stale revision refuses with
    the *current* hash and **leaves the file byte-for-byte unchanged**, an
    absent `expectedRevision` writes unconditionally (the lock is opt-in), and
    a supplied revision against a missing file writes rather than conflicting
    (the `currentRevision !== null &&` guard). Plus `getCurrentWorkflow` on a
    missing file, the atomic write leaving no `.tmp` sibling, parent-directory
    creation, and the revision being sha256 over the content **including the
    trailing newline** — asserted against the newline-less hash explicitly,
    since that is the variant a regression would produce.
  - `tools.test.ts` (sections B + C): every case pairs the reply assertion with
    a file-on-disk assertion, because the failure that hurts is a write that
    happened when it should not have. `apply_workflow` — malformed JSON,
    validation refusal (validation treated as a black box), the success shape
    with `autoCreatedFiles` **absent** rather than empty, and the case worth
    naming: **a stale revision surfaces as `success: false` but NOT as
    `isError`**, because the handler wraps the adapter result in `ok()`, so a
    caller keying off `isError` alone would read a refused write as a success.
    `update_nodes` — batch atomicity (one unknown id in a batch writes
    nothing, not even the valid half), shallow merge, explicit-null deletion,
    the three type-change branches, and the destructive `parentId` pair:
    explicit `null` un-groups, an absent key leaves the grouping alone.
- **On the read→write race**: the first attempt at the revision-passthrough
  case asserted nothing — a mutation dropping the `revision ?? current.revision`
  fallback at `tools.ts:349` left the suite green, because with
  `expectedRevision: undefined` the adapter writes unconditionally and still
  reports success. The handler's read and write are back-to-back, so no test
  driving it from outside can get between them. Fixed with a test-only
  `RacingAdapter` that delegates to `FileWorkflowAdapter` and lands a
  concurrent write inside `getCurrentWorkflow`; the mutation is now caught.
  Recorded because the weak version looked correct and passed.
- **Verified the suites bite** by hand-mutating eight things and restoring each:
  the `currentRevision !== null` guard, the `'parentId' in update` guard, the
  `missingIds` atomicity check, the type-change replace branch, the revision
  fallback, the type-change-without-data refusal, the null-delete loop, and the
  trailing newline in the hash. Each made a named assertion fail.
- **Bugs filed**: none in `packages/*/src` — the write path behaved as
  specified in every case. Filed **#1011** (`qa`, not `bug`): `pnpm build`
  compiles test files and fixtures into `packages/core/dist`, which is in the
  published `files` list, so 29 test artifacts importing `vitest` ship to npm.
  Low severity (nothing reachable from the entry points imports them) but it is
  a regression this loop introduced and it grows with each suite. Not fixed
  here — the fix touches `packages/*/tsconfig.json`, build config the feature
  loop also owns, and it is unrelated to #1006.
- **Residual scope on #1006**: none — the issue is the write half of S5 and all
  18 named cases landed. The read/discovery half (`list_available_agents`,
  `get_workflow_schema`) is deferred by the issue itself: both reach outside a
  temp dir (`os.homedir()`, `import.meta.resolve`) with no injection point, so
  making them deterministic is a feature-track change, not a QA one.

## 2026-07-25 — S2: the core generators (Mermaid, Markdown, agent skills)
- **Protects**: if this breaks, every export surface — `ccwf render`, the MCP
  `render_workflow` tool, the canvas "Copy as Markdown", and all six
  non-Claude skill targets — silently emits a diagram or instruction document
  that is wrong or unparseable, and the user only finds out wherever the agent
  later runs.
- **Issue/PR**: #995 / PR from `claude/qa-core-generators`
- **Outcome**: done — three suites in `packages/core/src/services/`, plus
  shared fixtures in `__fixtures__/workflows.ts`:
  - `workflow-prompt-generator.test.ts` (items 1 + 2, the AI-facing half):
    id sanitization against Mermaid reserved words and the end-to-end
    invariant that node definitions and edges sanitize identically; label
    escaping for every character that closes a shape; **node shapes asserted
    against the vocabulary the execution instructions use** ("Rectangle nodes
    (Sub-Agent: ...)", "Diamond nodes (AskUserQuestion:...)", …) — a contract
    between two artifacts this module generates, so a shape change without a
    prose change is caught; branch/option edge labelling including the
    deliberately-unlabelled AI-suggestion and multi-select cases; group
    subgraphs with no duplicate definitions; prompt-body verbatim
    preservation; Codex shell-command quote escaping; group-table pipe
    escaping; built-in `subagent_type` and CC-only model omission per
    provider; determinism.
  - `workflow-overview-formatter.test.ts` (item 2, the human-facing half):
    topological order at a merge point, cycle tolerance (each node exactly
    once), unreachable nodes still rendered, groups flattened, the
    `## <sanitizedId>(<title>)` heading the scroll-sync keys off, 4-backtick
    fencing so a prompt containing a code block survives, inline escaping, and
    branch-ordered next-step links.
  - `agent-skill-export.test.ts` (item 4): all six providers produce a
    structurally sound SKILL.md from one generator; Cursor is the only
    provider that mirrors Sub-Agent files; planned paths are relative,
    forward-slashed and contain no `..`; and **both directions of agreement
    with the README's "Supported Agents" table** — every provider is
    documented, every SKILL.md lands under a documented directory, and every
    documented directory actually receives a file.
  - Verified the suites bite by hand-mutating six things: the sub-agent node
    shape, the prompt label's `escapeLabel` call, Cursor's `agentsDir`, the
    Codex `skillsDir` (README divergence), the overview's 4-backtick fence,
    and the topological sort. Each made a named assertion fail. The
    merge-point fixture was restrung after mutation 6 showed declaration
    order satisfied it by accident.
- **Bugs filed**: **#1009** — `generateAgentSkillContent` interpolates the
  workflow description into the SKILL.md frontmatter unescaped, while
  `generateSlashCommandFile` in the same package routes the identical value
  through `escapeYamlString`. A description containing `:` (or a newline)
  therefore produces invalid YAML for all six non-Claude targets and the skill
  silently never loads. Test landed **skipped** naming the issue; the fix is
  the feature loop's, since it touches `packages/core/src`.
- **Residual scope on #995**: item 3 (Claude Code export artifacts checked
  against `packages/vscode/specs/001-cc-wf-studio/spec.md`) is **not** in this
  PR — the issue itself gates it on a human first updating that spec, which is
  still stale (it lists sub-agent models as `sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku` while
  `CC_ONLY_MODELS` now carries `haiku`/`fable`). Items 1, 2 and 4 all landed
  here. #995 stays open for item 3.

## 2026-07-25 — S1: validator behavior and authoring-guide ↔ zod consistency
- **Protects**: if this breaks, an AI agent follows
  `resources/workflow-schema.json`, authors a workflow the validator then
  rejects, and gets an error that does not say which node is at fault — so
  the agent cannot repair it and the user's edit never lands.
- **Issue/PR**: #994 / PR from `claude/qa-validator-and-schema-consistency`
- **Outcome**: done — two suites in `packages/core`:
  - `src/schema/authoring-guide-consistency.test.ts` relates the two
    independently maintained representations of a node's properties (the
    hand-written AI-authoring guide and the zod schemas). Asserts the
    guide → zod direction: node-type coverage in both directions against a
    documented exception list (`start`/`end` have no zod schema; `branch` is
    legacy and deliberately not offered to AI), field coverage against a
    hand-validated allowlist (`outputPorts` everywhere, SubAgent
    `commandFilePath`/`commandScope`), **every enum value and default the
    guide advertises is accepted by the zod field**, and every example
    workflow embedded in the guide passes `validateAIGeneratedWorkflow`.
  - `src/utils/validate-workflow.test.ts` covers the validator's behavior
    rather than the schema's content: errors name the offending node and
    field, one error per offending node, absent fields are skipped (old
    files keep loading), `visibleWhen`-inactive fields are skipped, corrupt
    input (null / array / string node data, non-object workflow) becomes a
    structured error instead of a TypeError, and the `maxNodes` boundary.
  - Verified the suites bite by hand-mutating four things: adding an
    undocumented node type to the guide, adding a `model` enum value zod
    rejects, dropping the node id from the schema-violation `field`, and
    disabling the `visibleWhen` skip. Each made a named assertion fail.
- **Bugs filed**: none — the guide and the zod schemas agree today, and all
  three embedded examples validate.
- **Residual scope on #994**: items 3 (generator coverage against the
  schema) and 4 (regression pinning) are not in this PR. Item 3 needs the
  generators and belongs with #995 (S2); item 4 is reactive and there is no
  defect to pin yet. The issue's own "Done when" clause covers only items
  1 and 2, both of which landed here.

## 2026-07-25 — S0: vitest foundation and the CI test gate
- **Protects**: nothing on its own — it is the gate every other suite needs.
  Until this landed, CI proved only that the code compiled, so a behavioral
  regression could merge unopposed on `auto-dev` and `auto-qa`.
- **Issue/PR**: #993 / PR from `claude/qa-vitest-foundation`
- **Outcome**: done — `vitest.config.ts` + the `vitest` devDependency added to
  `core`, `cli`, and `mcp`; every `test` script (including the webview's) set
  to `vitest run --passWithNoTests` so an empty suite doesn't fail the run;
  `pnpm test` added to `ci.yml` after `pnpm check`.
  Also wired the **pre-existing MCP smoke test** into CI — it was a real
  behavioral check that no workflow ever executed, so connecting it was the
  cheapest assurance available.
  Verified the gate actually bites: breaking an assertion by hand makes the
  run exit 1.
- **Bugs filed**: none
- **Note for the next iteration**: the first test
  (`packages/core/src/services/workflow-export.test.ts`, covering
  `nodeNameToFileName`) exists to prove the wiring, not to cover S2. It is
  deliberately checked against the naming rule written in
  `packages/vscode/specs/001-cc-wf-studio/spec.md`, not against the
  implementation — per `docs/quality/03-assurance-map.md`, a test read off
  the code it tests is a transcription, not a check.

## 2026-07-25 — Bootstrap the quality-assurance track
- **Protects**: nothing yet — this is the machinery that will.
- **Issue/PR**: (this bootstrap PR)
- **Outcome**: done — `auto-qa` integration branch, `next-qa` skill,
  CI trigger for `auto-qa`, testing-policy change in `CLAUDE.md` and
  `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and a seeded `qa` backlog.
- **Bugs filed**: none
