# Progress Log

Append-only memory of the autonomous value-creation loop. The `next-task`
skill appends one entry per implementation iteration (newest first); both
it and the `next-idea` skill read recent entries to avoid repeating
finished or abandoned work. Humans may annotate entries but should not
rewrite history.

Entry format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short task title>
- **User value**: <one sentence — "a user can now X" / "no longer suffers Y">
- **Issue/PR**: #NN / #MM
- **Outcome**: done | abandoned (<why>) | blocked (<on what>)
- **Next proposals**: <0–3 bullets for the following iteration>
```

## 2026-07-21 — Bootstrap the value-creation loop
- **User value**: none directly — this is the machine that will produce it.
- **Issue/PR**: (this setup PR)
- **Outcome**: done — next-task skill (invention-centric), auto-dev two-stage
  flow, CI gate, unattended-failure detection, 30-min scheduled routines.
- **Next proposals**:
  - First real iteration: walk the canvas → export → share flow as a user
    and propose the top friction fix.
