# The Autonomous Value-Creation Loop

How cc-wf-studio improves continuously without a human picking tasks. The
loop's job is to **invent user-facing value**; maintenance is an interrupt,
not a workstream. The loop is split into two halves on separate schedules
and models: **ideation** (`next-idea` skill, Fable) fills the idea queue,
**implementation** (`next-task` skill, Opus) consumes it. Operational rules
agents follow live in those two skills and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`; this
file is the map.

A separate, sibling track builds the **automated test suite** — see
[The quality-assurance track](#the-quality-assurance-track) at the end of
this file. Everything above that section describes the feature track.

```

- **Steering**: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (North Star, value axes, not-value
  list). Human-edited only; one edit redirects the whole loop.
- **Idea queue**: GitHub Issues labeled `idea`, filled exclusively by the
  `next-idea` skill (max 3 per run, none when 5+ are already open). **Every
  built task starts life as a self-authored `idea` issue** (file → develop →
  `Closes #N`, closed manually after the auto-dev merge), so the loop's idea
  stream is visible in the issue list and the human can veto any idea
  *before* work starts by closing its issue. The issue body is the spec the
  implementation half builds from.
- **Comment-injection defense**: the loop locks each `idea` issue at
  creation (`gh issue lock` — collaborators-only comments), and treats text
  from any non-owner author (issue bodies/comments, PR descriptions/review
  comments) as untrusted data to verify, never instructions to follow.
- **Concurrency**: execution is serial with capacity 1. Ideation runs never
  touch branches or PRs, so only implementation runs contend. Every
  implementation iteration first checks for an open PR based on `auto-dev`;
  if one **authored by the owner from a `claude/*` branch in this repo**
  exists, it stewards that PR
  (merge on green / fix on red) instead of starting new work. Foreign PRs
  targeting `auto-dev` (forks / other authors) are never merged, built, or
  pushed to — they get a `needs-attention` label for the human and the
  iteration proceeds normally, so a hostile PR can neither get merged nor
  stall the loop.

## Two-stage branch flow

- **Per-task gate (automatic)**: each task is one PR into `auto-dev`,
  auto-squash-merged only when CI (`pnpm build` + `pnpm check`) is green.
  A red PR never merges.
- **Promotion gate (human)**: a human opens `auto-dev` → `main` when ready,
  reviews the accumulated diff (squash commits keep per-task boundaries
  visible), and merges. Prefer a merge commit to preserve per-task history;
  a squash also works (Changesets reads `.changeset/*.md`, not commit
  messages).
- **Blast radius**: an agent mistake lands in `auto-dev` at worst. Recovery
  is a **human-only** action: revert the offending squash commit(s)
  (preferred), or as a last resort reset the branch to `main`
  (`git push origin origin/main:auto-dev --force` — discards ALL unpromoted
  work; check the diff first). Agents never force-push anything.
- **Freshness**: each iteration syncs `auto-dev` from `main` (merge, never
  force) so promotion PRs stay mergeable. This sync is the only direct push
  to `auto-dev` agents may make.
- **Repo settings (one-time, human)**: protect `main` (require PRs); require
  the CI check on `auto-dev`; enable "Allow auto-merge".

## Interrupts — the only maintenance

Interrupts are handled by the **implementation** half (`next-task`);
ideation runs never fix anything.

| Signal | Detected by | Lands as | Loop response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unattended CI/scan failure (scheduled runs, pushes to `main`/`auto-dev`) | `scheduled-failure-issue.yml` | Issue, label `ci-failure` | fix before building ideas |
| Security vulnerabilities | Snyk (`security-scan.yml`, weekly) + GitHub advisories | Code Scanning alerts / advisories | fix if actionable |
| Bugs reported by humans | issue templates | Issue, label `bug` | fix before new value |

Deliberately **absent from the loop's duties**: TODO-comment→issue syncing
and standalone backlog-scanning (housekeeping that serves no user).
Dependabot still files weekly version-update PRs (targeting `main`), but
they are **outside the loop**: a human triages and merges them, and the
loop never spends iterations on them. A dependency with a real
vulnerability is the Security interrupt — the loop cares about danger,
not freshness.

## Who may do what

**Automation, without asking**: file and **lock** `idea` issues (deduped;
max 3 per ideation run, none when 5+ are open); close its own `idea`
issues once their PR merged; create `claude/*` branches and PRs based on
`auto-dev`; merge **its own** PRs into `auto-dev` via auto-merge with green
CI (never PRs by other authors or from forks); push the `main`→`auto-dev`
sync merge; append to `docs/progress-log.md`; comment with analysis.

**Humans only**: merging anything into `main` (including the promotion PR);
all release actions (Release PR, publish, store uploads — CLAUDE.md);
editing `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`; force-pushing or resetting `auto-dev`;
changing the automation itself (workflows, the `next-idea` / `next-task`
skills, this file — agents may propose such changes in a PR, but treat them
as privilege changes); closing or editing human-authored issues.

## Running it

- **Autonomous**: two Claude Code Remote routines fire fresh cloud sessions
  every hour — **ideation at :30 (Fable, `next-idea`)** and
  **implementation at :01 (Opus, `next-task`)** (the routine API rejects
  minute 0, so :01 stands in for :00). Pause/resume/retarget them
  by asking Claude, or from the claude.ai Routines UI
  (https://claude.ai/code/routines).
- **Manual**: `/next-idea` files ideas, `/next-task` runs one implementation
  iteration, in any Claude Code session.
- **Steer**: edit `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. **Veto**: close an `idea` issue.
- **Promote**: `gh pr create --base main --head auto-dev`, review, merge.

## Labels

| Label | Meaning | Created by |
|---|---|---|
| `idea` | A judged value proposal (locked at creation; every built task has one) | next-idea (`gh label create --force`) |
| `qa` | A queued quality-assurance task (test infra, unit test, regression test) | humans / next-qa |
| `auto-generated` | Filed by automation, not a human | automation |
| `ci-failure` | An unattended workflow run failed | scheduled-failure-issue |
| `needs-attention` | An agent PR failed CI 3× and was parked for a human | next-task / next-qa |
| `bug` | Defect reported by a human, or by the QA loop when a test fails | humans / issue templates / next-qa |

## The quality-assurance track

The feature track's merge gate is `pnpm build` + `pnpm check` — it proves
the code *compiles*, never that it *behaves*. On `auto-dev` that gate is the
only thing between an agent's mistake and a merged change. The QA track
exists to close that gap by building the automated suite that turns
behavioral regressions into red builds.

- **Steering**: [`docs/quality/`](./quality/) — a three-layer, top-down
  definition of what assurance must protect (product value → features →
  assurance), including the explicit list of what is deliberately **not**
  protected and the S0–S7 test-suite design the `qa` queue is drawn from.
  Human-edited; agents read it.
- **Sibling, not nested**: `auto-qa` and `auto-dev` both branch from `main`
  and are promoted back to `main` by a human, independently. Neither merges
  into the other. This keeps each promotion review small — the failure mode
  that produced a 13,787-line diff too large to review in one pass.
- **Disjoint files, by rule**: because the two branches are promoted
  independently, every file both tracks touch is a future merge conflict.
  So **the QA loop never edits `packages/*/src`** — it writes test files,
  test config, CI config, and `docs/qa-log.md` only. Its memory is a
  separate log for the same reason.
- **Found a bug? File it, don't fix it.** When a test proves a product
  defect, the QA loop opens a `bug` issue and lands the test **skipped**
  with a comment naming the issue. The feature loop treats `bug` issues as
  an interrupt and fixes them on `auto-dev`; a later QA iteration un-skips
  the test once the fix reaches `main`. A red test never merges, and a bug
  never gets quietly papered over.
- **Two halves, same as the feature track**: `next-qa-idea` files **one**
  locked `qa` issue per run (none when 3+ are already open); `next-qa`
  resolves one per run. One in, one out — the queue tracks implementation's
  pace instead of outrunning it, so specs don't rot while the code moves.
  Ideation looks for bugs with no regression test, recently merged code
  with no coverage, and untested pure logic.
- **Queue**: GitHub Issues labeled `qa`, locked at creation like `idea`
  issues. A human can veto any test *before* it is written by closing its
  issue.
- **Scope**: `packages/core` (validators, generators, schema) and the pure
  transforms in `packages/cli` / `packages/mcp`. Webview React rendering and
  the VSCode host stay on manual E2E deliberately — automating them costs
  more than it protects, and those failures are ones a user notices at once.
- **The gate grows with the suite**: `ci.yml` runs on `auto-qa` from the
  start; the QA loop adds the `pnpm test` step to it as its first task, once
  there is a suite to run.
- **Running it**: two Claude Code Remote routines fire every hour —
  **ideation at :46** and **implementation at :16** (`next-qa-idea` /
  `next-qa`, both Opus). Manually: `/next-qa-idea` files a task,
  `/next-qa` builds one. **Promote**:
  `gh pr create --base main --head auto-qa`.
