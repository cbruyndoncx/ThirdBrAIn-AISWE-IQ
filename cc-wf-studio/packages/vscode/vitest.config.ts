// (and its own browser-global setup), so it is excluded here by the narrow
// `include` rather than by an ignore rule.
//
// `environment: 'node'` is deliberate: the modules covered here are pure —
// they neither import `vscode` nor touch the DOM — so no mocks and no jsdom.
// Anything that reaches the extension host or the filesystem stays on manual
// E2E; see `docs/quality/03-assurance-map.md`.
