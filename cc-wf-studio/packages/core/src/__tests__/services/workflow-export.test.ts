/**
 * The first test in the repository. Its job is to prove the vitest wiring
 * works end to end (see the `qa` issue for the S0 foundation task), so it
 * stays deliberately small.
 *
 * It targets `nodeNameToFileName` rather than something trivial because the
 * naming rule is stated independently of the code, in
 * `packages/vscode/specs/001-cc-wf-studio/spec.md` (Export Format Details):
 *
 *   > ファイル名: ノード名を小文字化し、スペースをハイフンに置換
 *   > (例: "Data Analysis" → "data-analysis.md")
 *
 * Checking the implementation against a separately maintained specification
 * relates two artifacts, so it is a real check rather than a transcription of
 * the code — the distinction drawn in `docs/quality/03-assurance-map.md`.
