# OOLONG (`trec_coarse`) long-context eval subset

A small, self-contained evaluation set for scoring **any** long-context method —
a base model call, an agent, a retrieval/compaction scaffold, the `/rlm` skill,
etc. — on a genuinely **long-context**, information-dense reasoning task. You
produce a predictions file with whatever system you like and score it; the eval
has no dependency on any particular method.

> **The `/rlm` skill is _not_ required to run or score this eval.** It is only one
> example method. If the RLM skill is unavailable — or you simply want to benchmark a
> different system (a plain base-model call, an agent, a retrieval/compaction scaffold,
> etc.) — **do not invoke RLM**: run your own harness that maps
> `(context_file, question) → answer`, write the predictions file (below), and score it
> the same way. The `/rlm` invocation shown later is illustrative, not a prerequisite.

## Why this benchmark

The reference paper (`paper/2512.24601v3.pdf`, *Recursive Language Models*, arXiv:2512.24601)
reports four long-context benchmarks in its Table 1 — **CodeQA**, **BrowseComp-Plus**,
**OOLONG**, and **OOLONG-Pairs** (§3.1/Figure 1 also use **S-NIAH** as a scaling baseline).
Of these, **OOLONG** is the cleanest fit for a setup that operates over a
*single large context file + a query*. The paper describes it as (§3.1, verbatim):

> **OOLONG** [Bertsch et al., 2025]. A long reasoning benchmark that requires semantically
> labeling and aggregating these labels to form a final answer. We focus specifically on
> the `trec_coarse` split, a set of 50 tasks over a dataset of questions with semantic
> labels. Each task requires using nearly all dataset questions, and therefore scales
> linearly in processing complexity relative to the input length.

This subset samples **10 of those tasks** (see *Subset statistics* below).

OOLONG is also the paper's headline scaling task (Figure 1) and is the one where the
RLM most clearly beats the base model (Table 1: GPT-5 base 44.0 → RLM 56–58; the answer
"depends explicitly on almost every line in the prompt"). That is exactly the property
we want to test: the model cannot succeed by retrieving a single "needle" — it must
process the whole context.

Each item is one OOLONG `trec_coarse` task at a context length of **131,072 tokens**
(~310 KB of text), matching the OOLONG column in the paper's Table 1 (`N = 131K`).
The 10 items are drawn over the **2 distinct long contexts** available at this length
(`context_window_id` 6 and 8, each 3,182 labelled TREC questions); contexts are stored
once and shared by the items that use them. **Context is never trimmed** — each
`contexts/*.txt` holds the entire context verbatim (the file you feed to your method
is the exact, full context).

### Manifest fields (`data/oolong_trec_coarse.jsonl`)

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | OOLONG item id |
| `context_window_id` | which of the 2 shared long contexts this item uses (6 or 8) |
| `context_len_tokens` | native context length (131072) |
| `context_chars` | characters in the model-facing context file |
| `num_labels` | number of distinct semantic labels (6 for trec_coarse) |
| `task` / `task_group` | task type (e.g. `TASK_TYPE.MOST_FREQ`) / group (`counting`) |
| `answer_type` | `ANSWER_TYPE.LABEL` / `NUMERIC` / `COMPARISON` |
| `question` | the exact task prompt to answer about the context |
| `answer` | gold answer as a stringified list; the scorer compares against element `[0]` |
| `context_file` | model-facing context (relative path) — **the only thing the model sees** |
| `context_with_labels_file` | gold-labeled context, for independent verification only |

## The task

The context is a list of short natural-language items (TREC questions), each attributed
to a user and a date, **with no labels shown**. The model must infer each item's coarse
semantic class — one of *description and abstract concept, entity, human being, numeric
value, location, abbreviation* — and then aggregate across the whole context to answer a
distributional question, e.g.:

- *which label is the most / least common?* (`LABEL`)
- *is label A more / less common than label B?* (`COMPARISON`)
- *how many items are label X?* (`NUMERIC`)

The labels are never given in the input, so the model must label essentially every line
and then aggregate — defeating retrieval-style shortcuts.

## How to run the eval

For each item in the manifest, run **your system** over its context file with its
question, and record its final answer. Then score. The eval is method-agnostic:
"your system" can be a single base-model call, an agent, a retrieval/compaction
scaffold, or the `/rlm` skill — anything that maps (context_file, question) → answer.

1. **Produce an answer per item.** Use each item's `context_file` and `question`
   from the manifest (several items share a context file). For example, with the
   RLM skill in this repo:

   ```
   /rlm context=.claude/skills/rlm/eval/data/contexts/trec_coarse_cw8.txt query=<the item's question>
   ```

   …or feed the same context file + question to any other method. Collect each
   run's final answer into a predictions file, one JSON object per line:

   ```json
   {"id": <id>, "output": "<your system's final answer text>"}
   ```

   (`output` can be the full final answer; the scorer extracts the answer after the last
   `:` exactly as the official OOLONG harness does, so answers phrased like
   `Label: entity` or `Answer: 37` score correctly.)

   To **record token/cost usage**, add any of these optional fields to a line and the
   scorer will aggregate and report them (see *Recording token/cost usage* below):

   ```json
   {"id": <id>, "output": "...", "total_tokens": 12345, "total_cost_usd": 0.01}
   ```

2. **Score:**

   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/rlm/eval/score.py --predictions preds.jsonl
   ```

   Prints a per-item table and the mean score (0–1, ×100 for a percentage comparable to
   the paper's Table 1 OOLONG column). This uses the official OOLONG-synth scoring code —
   the same per-item scorer the upstream repo applies for that column. Note the paper does
   not state OOLONG's metric explicitly (only BrowseComp = "percentage correct" and
   OOLONG-Pairs = "F1" are defined), so treat the comparison as based on the upstream
   scorer rather than a metric the paper formally specifies.

### Sanity check

```bash
python .claude/skills/rlm/eval/score.py --self-test
```

Feeds the gold answers back through the parser+scorer; should report mean score ≈ 1.00.
If it doesn't, the manifest and scorer are out of sync.

## Recording token/cost usage

The scorer reports how many tokens (and, optionally, how much money) a run consumed,
as long as your predictions carry that information. Usage fields are **optional** and
method-agnostic — add whatever your system reports to each prediction line. The scorer
reads them in this priority order and sums across items:

- `total_tokens` (or `tokens`) — a single integer; or
- a nested `usage` object containing `total_tokens`; or
- component fields `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens` /
  `cache_read_input_tokens` (at top level or inside `usage`), which are summed. This
  matches the `usage` object returned by `claude -p --output-format json`.

Cost is read from `total_cost_usd` / `cost_usd` / `cost`.

Usage is then reported per item (a `tokens` column) and in aggregate, e.g.:

```
Scored 10 items | mean score = 0.5237 (52.4%)
Tokens | total = 1,240,118 | mean/item = 124,012 (reported for 10/10 items)
Cost   | total = $0.2153 | mean/item = $0.0215 (reported for 10/10 items)
```

Predictions without usage fields still score fine; the `tokens` column just shows `-`.

**Capturing usage from a `claude -p` run.** Run the method with JSON output and copy the
usage straight into the prediction line:

```bash
claude -p --output-format json --model haiku --allowedTools "" < prompt.txt > out.json
python - <<'PY'
import json
d = json.load(open("out.json"))
print(json.dumps({"id": 17000208, "output": d["result"], "usage": d["usage"],
                  "total_cost_usd": d.get("total_cost_usd")}))
PY
```

For a multi-call method (e.g. the RLM, which fans out many sub-calls), sum the usage
across all calls and record the total as `total_tokens` / `total_cost_usd` for the item.

## Scoring details

`score.py` is a faithful re-implementation of `synth_process_response` /
`synth_attempt_answer_parse` from the official OOLONG repo
(`_upstream_ref/eval_helpers.py`). Summary:

- gold = first element of the stringified `answer` list;
- the model output is parsed by taking text after the last `:` and stripping `*`/`[`/`]`;
- **exact string match → 1.0**;
- `COMPARISON` answers (`more/less common`, `same frequency`) match by phrase;
- `NUMERIC` answers get partial credit `0.75 ** |gold − pred|`;
- everything else → 0.0.

## Subset statistics

- **10 items** over **2 long contexts** (`context_window_id` 6 and 8), each **131,072 tokens**
  (cw6 = 308,367 chars, cw8 = 316,769 chars; 625,136 chars of unique model-facing context).
- **Task mix:** `MOST_FREQ` ×1, `LEAST_FREQ` ×1, `NUMERIC_ONE_CLASS` ×4, `RELATIVE_FREQ` ×4.
- **Answer types:** `LABEL` ×2, `NUMERIC` ×4, `COMPARISON` ×4.
- **Verified:** every gold answer was independently re-derived from the labelled context
  (`_cache/verify_eval.py`), and the scorer self-test scores 1.00 (`score.py --self-test`).
  The per-context **gold label distributions and comparison outcomes are not shown here**
  (they are answers): they live in the read-guarded
  `data/contexts_with_labels/GOLD_LABEL_STATS.md`, so a blind eval session cannot read
  them. (Note: this STATS block is regenerated by `_cache/build_eval.py`; that generator
  must keep gold distributions out of the committed README.)

### Reproducing the data

```bash
python .claude/skills/rlm/eval/_cache/pyarrow_fetch.py   # download trec_coarse@131072 rows (HF parquet)
python .claude/skills/rlm/eval/_cache/build_eval.py      # select 10 items -> contexts/ + manifest
python .claude/skills/rlm/eval/_cache/verify_eval.py     # re-derive every gold answer (integrity check)
```

The download step needs network/HF access plus two libraries
(`pip install "pyarrow>=14" "huggingface_hub>=0.20"`); `build_eval.py`, `verify_eval.py`,
and `score.py` are dependency-free (stdlib only). Note `pyarrow_fetch.py` reads the HF
auto-converted parquet under `refs/convert/parquet/…` — that ref is regenerated by HF and
its shard paths can change over time; the already-built `data/` does not depend on it.
