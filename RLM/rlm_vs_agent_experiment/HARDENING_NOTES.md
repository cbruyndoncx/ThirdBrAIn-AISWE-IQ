# Blind-eval hardening — status & validation notes (issue #6)

Implements the fixes from the Codex methodology review. **Nothing has been run for
real** (no model calls); validation so far is static only. This file is the inspection
surface before the next live run.

## What changed (by Codex finding)

| Finding | Fix | Files |
|---|---|---|
| README leaked gold label distributions | Scrubbed gold out of the committed README into a read-guarded file | `eval/README.md`, `eval/data/contexts_with_labels/GOLD_LABEL_STATS.md` |
| Bash/grep bypass; case variants | Per-task **blind sandbox** (cwd) holding only the context (+skill for RLM); hardened repo guards (case-insensitive, README) | `eval_sandbox.py`, `.claude/settings.json` |
| Cross-arm leak (seal not wired in) | **Obviated** by the sandbox — a later arm's session cannot see a prior arm's `runs/` (not in its sandbox). Per-arm seal/unseal retired; `seal_run.py` kept for `archive` provenance | `run_rlm_skill_eval.py` |
| Control spawns its own `claude` (uncounted) | **D2: account via shim** — transparent `claude` shim first on the control sandbox PATH logs child usage; plus transcript **detection** (`spawned_submodel_calls`) | `eval_sandbox.py`, `run_rlm_skill_eval.py` |
| Orchestration-failure not faithful | `read_context_directly` now **fails** the RLM item (`CONTEXT_READ_DIRECT`); detector extended to Bash reads; failure rate printed | `run_rlm_skill_eval.py` |
| n=10 / 2 contexts / partial credit | Reporting discipline (REPORT.md framing) — applied when results exist | (REPORT.md, later) |

## Integrity guarantees are env-INDEPENDENT (robust)

- **Sandbox isolation:** each `claude -p` runs with cwd = a fresh temp dir containing
  only `context.txt` (+ the skill for RLM / the shim for controls). The manifest,
  labels, README, `_cache`, `_archive`, other arms' `runs/`, and `REPORT.md` are simply
  **not present** — not reachable by relative `ls`/`grep -r`/`cat`.
- **Per-arm sandbox guards:** the scaffold guard is written **only** into control
  sandboxes as an *unconditional* grep (no env gate) — control sandboxes deny
  `rlm_repl`/`llm_query`/`rlm_query`; RLM sandboxes allow them. (Verified statically.)
- **`--disallowedTools Skill`** for controls (the proven, real restriction under
  `bypassPermissions`).
- **Transcript detection** (`control_used_rlm`, `spawned_submodel_calls`,
  `read_context_directly`) is parsed from the stream — independent of any env var.

## git-bash env propagation — now MITIGATED (env-free accounting)

On this Windows machine a freshly-passed env var does not reach `bash -c`
(`python -> git-bash` drops it; `python -> python`/`cmd` keep it). The Codex
implementation review confirmed this would silently zero env-based cost accounting.
**Accounting is now env-free:**

- **RLM leaf cost**: the copied `rlm_repl` reads its usage-log path from a sandbox file
  (`scripts/leaf_log_path.txt`) when `RLM_LEAF_USAGE_LOG` is absent (the env var is still
  set as a fallback).
- **Control shim**: `REAL_CLAUDE` + the child-usage log path are **baked** into the
  generated `claude_shim.py` (env is only a fallback).

The one remaining live-only dependency is **PATH resolution** of `claude` → the control
shim inside git-bash. If that fails, control child cost reads 0 — now **reported as "NOT
cost-accounted"** rather than silently as accounted. Sub-model-spawn *detection* is
transcript-based and env-free regardless. Confirm in the live smoke: RLM `leaf_cost > 0`,
and any control spawn is either accounted or clearly flagged unaccounted.

## Codex implementation-review fixes applied (on top of the above)

1. A crashed control (nonzero exit / no `result` event) now **fails** (`NO_RESULT_EVENT` /
   `EXIT_<n>`); stderr tail kept in diagnostics.
2. Direct-context-read detection now keys on a read-op/read-call that actually TARGETS
   `context.txt` (adjacency, not mere co-occurrence): catches `cat context.txt`, compound
   `... && cat context.txt`, and `open()`/`.read_text()`/`read_csv()` — and does NOT
   false-positive on legit RLM `exec` code that merely mentions `grep`/`wc` on other lines.
   (Unit-tested in `verify_guards.py`.)
3. Control sandboxes now deny the repo `/rlm` skill by absolute path (incl. `SKILL.md`),
   closing the absolute-path skill-doc leak.
6. Guard patterns are separator-free / tolerate Windows backslashes (`eval..?readme`, `_cache`).
7. Control sub-model cost is reported as accounted only when it actually was.

## Live-validation checklist (run during inspection — these spawn `claude`)

```
python rlm_vs_agent_experiment/verify_guards.py            # static (passes now)
python rlm_vs_agent_experiment/verify_guards.py --live <id>  # 1 item/arm, asserts guards
```

Confirm: (1) RLM **skill discovery** works in the sandbox cwd (FINAL produced);
(2) RLM **leaf cost > 0** (env reached `rlm_repl`); (3) control shows **no**
Skill/scaffold use; (4) any control sub-model spawn is **flagged** (and, if env
propagates, cost-accounted); (5) transcripts show **no** answer-key path access.
