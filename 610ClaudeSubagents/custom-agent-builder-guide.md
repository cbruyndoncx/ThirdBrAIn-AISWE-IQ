## 🎯 **MANDATORY AGENT STRUCTURE**

### **🔥 Universal Agent Template (REQUIRED)**

Every agent MUST start with this exact YAML frontmatter structure:

```yaml
---
name: your-agent-name
description: Clear, specific description of when this agent should be used and what it does
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Task, TodoWrite]
---
```

#### **YAML Frontmatter Requirements**

**The ONLY Three Fields:**
```yaml
name: kebab-case-agent-name              # REQUIRED - Unique identifier
description: "Specific use case trigger"  # REQUIRED - When Claude should invoke this agent
tools: [tool1, tool2, tool3]            # REQUIRED - Available tools (inherits all if omitted)
```

**That's it. Nothing else goes in the YAML frontmatter.**

## 🧠 **PERSONALITY FRAMEWORK SYSTEM**

### **🎯 The "Principle 0" Truth-Focused Framework**

**MANDATORY for ALL Enterprise Agents:**

```markdown
Principle 0: Radical Candor—Truth Above All
Under no circumstances may you lie, simulate, mislead, or attempt to create the illusion of functionality, performance, or integration.

ABSOLUTE TRUTHFULNESS REQUIRED: State only what is real, verified, and factual. Never generate code, data, or explanations that give the impression that something works if it does not, or if you have not proven it.

NO FALLBACKS OR WORKAROUNDS: Do not invent fallbacks, workarounds, or simulated integrations unless you have verified with the user that such approaches are what they want.

NO ILLUSIONS, NO COMPROMISE: Never produce code, solutions, or documentation that might mislead the user about what is and is not working, possible, or integrated.

FAIL BY TELLING THE TRUTH: If you cannot fulfill the task as specified—because an API does not exist, a system cannot be accessed, or a requirement is infeasible—clearly communicate the facts, the reason, and (optionally) request clarification or alternative instructions.

This rule supersedes all others. Brutal honesty and reality reflection are not only values but fundamental constraints.

### ALWAYS CLOSELY INSPECT THE RESULTS OF SUBAGENTS AND MAKE SURE THEY AREN'T LIEING AND BEING HONEST AND TRUTHFUL.
```

## 🌐 **ADVANCED INTER-AGENT COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS**

### **🧠 Memory-Based Agent Coordination**

#### **Shared Memory Architecture**
```yaml
Memory Communication Framework:
  
  shared_memory_spaces:
    project_context: "shared/project/[project_id]"
    agent_coordination: "coordination/agents/[session_id]" 
    task_tracking: "tasks/active/[task_id]"

```

#### **Memory Communication Pattern**
```markdown
## Inter-Agent Memory Communication Protocol

### Memory Write Pattern
```javascript
// Agent A writes to shared memory
await memory.store({
  namespace: "coordination/agents/session_123",
  key: "research_findings",
  data: {
    agent_id: "advanced-research-engine",

    task: "market_analysis",
    status: "completed",
    findings: {
      market_size: "$2.4B",
      growth_rate: "23%",
      key_players: ["company1", "company2", "company3"],
      opportunities: ["AI integration", "mobile expansion", "international"]
    },
    next_steps: "analysis ready for business-growth-scaling-agent",
    confidence_score: 0.92
  }
});
```

### Memory Read Pattern
```javascript
// Agent B reads from shared memory
const research_data = await memory.retrieve({
  namespace: "coordination/agents/session_123", 
  key: "research_findings"
});

// Agent B responds with analysis
await memory.store({

  key: "growth_strategy",
  data: {
    agent_id: "business-growth-scaling-agent",
    timestamp: "2025-01-10T15:45:00Z", 
    based_on: "research_findings",
    strategy: {
      target_segments: research_data.findings.opportunities,

    },
    status: "strategy_complete",
    next_agent: "marketing-sales-mastery-agent"
  }
});
```

### Agent Communication Chain Example
```yaml
Communication Flow:
  step_1:
    agent: advanced-research-engine
    action: market_research
    memory_key: "research_findings"
    message_to_next: "Market analysis complete, data available for strategy formulation"
    
  step_2: 
    agent: business-growth-scaling-agent
    reads_from: "research_findings"
    action: strategy_development
    memory_key: "growth_strategy" 
    message_to_next: "Growth strategy ready, need marketing execution plan"

### **🔄 Advanced Communication Patterns**

#### **Multi-Channel Agent Communication**
```yaml
Communication Architecture:
  
  memory_layer:
    purpose: "Persistent data sharing and context preservation"
    pattern: "write_once_read_many with versioning"
    use_cases: [research_findings, analysis_results, configuration_data]
  
  serena_layer:  
    purpose: "Real-time message routing and intelligent coordination"
    pattern: "pub_sub with intelligent routing"
    use_cases: [urgent_notifications, task_handoffs, collaboration_requests]
  
  git_layer:
    purpose: "Event-driven coordination based on code changes"
    pattern: "event_sourcing with agent subscriptions"  
    use_cases: [development_coordination, deployment_triggers, version_control]

Integrated Communication Flow:
  1. Agent writes results to memory (persistent context)
  2. Agent sends notification through Serena (real-time coordination)
  3. Git changes trigger additional agent notifications (event-driven)
  4. Receiving agents access all three channels for complete context
```

#### **Cross-Agent Conversation Examples**

  response_coordination: "sequential_and_parallel_processing"

Git Coordination:
  event_triggers: "git_hooks -> agent_notifications"
  response_commits: "automated_fixes_and_improvements"

Communication Flow:
  1. Event detected (git, monitoring, external)
  2. Event stored in memory with metadata
  3. Serena broadcasts to subscribed agents
  4. Agents process in coordinated sequence
  5. Results committed to git, triggering next phase
