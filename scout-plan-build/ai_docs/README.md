## Write Pattern Summary

| Folder | Pattern | Trigger | Created By |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| `build_reports/` | **DETERMINISTIC** | `/build_adw` completion | FileOrganizer |
| `sessions/` | **DETERMINISTIC** | `/session:prepare-compaction` | Command |
| `reviews/` | **MIXED** | `/git:compare-worktrees` or manual | Command + Session |
| `research/` | **MIXED** | `/utilities:research-add` | Command + Hook |
| `analyses/` | MANUAL | Analysis requests | Session |
| `architecture/` | MANUAL | Architecture docs | Session |
| `reference/` | MANUAL | Guide creation | Session |
| `assessments/` | MANUAL | Audits | Session |
| `feedback/` | MANUAL | Bug reports | Session |
| `archive/` | MANUAL | Cleanup operations | Session |

> **Legend**: DETERMINISTIC = programmatic, predictable. MANUAL = created during Claude sessions.

## Workflow Integration

```
Scout Phase  → scout_outputs/relevant_files.json
Plan Phase   → specs/issue-XXX-*.md
Build Phase  → ai_docs/build_reports/*-report.md
Review Phase → ai_docs/reviews/*-review.md
Session End  → ai_docs/sessions/handoffs/handoff-*.md
```

> **Note**: Scout outputs go to `scout_outputs/` (top-level), NOT `ai_docs/scout/`.

## Semantic Boundaries

| Folder | Contains | Direction |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| `reference/` | Internal knowledge about THIS project | Generated → Out |
| `research/` | External knowledge from OTHER sources | Sourced → In |
| `architecture/` | How things ARE built | Documentation |
| `analyses/` | What we LEARNED from analysis | Generated |

## Future Infrastructure (Planned Features)

Some folders are scaffolding for planned features:

| Folder | Status | Planned For |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `feedback/predictions/` | Empty | V2 Feedback Loop - stores AI predictions |
| `feedback/outcomes/` | Empty | V2 Feedback Loop - stores actual results |
| `feedback/corrections/` | Active | Bug documentation, learned patterns |

**Feedback Loop Architecture** (from Agentic Primitives V2):
```
PREDICT → OBSERVE → LEARN → APPLY
   ↓         ↓         ↓        ↓
predictions/ outcomes/ corrections/ → improved prompts
```

This enables continuous learning from AI predictions vs actual outcomes.
See `ai_docs/reference/AGENTIC_ENGINEERING_PRIMITIVES_V2.md` Section 8.

## Why This Organization?

- **SSOT**: Each content type has ONE canonical location
- **Predictability**: Deterministic folders have known triggers
- **Discoverability**: Easy to find all AI artifacts
- **Cleanup**: Manual folders need periodic triage (see archive/)
- **Future-Ready**: Empty folders may be scaffolding for planned features
