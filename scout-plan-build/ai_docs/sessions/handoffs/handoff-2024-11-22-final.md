# Session Handoff - 2024-11-22 (Final)

**Context Remaining:** ~35% at handoff
**Compaction Prompt:** `ai_docs/sessions/COMPACTION_PROMPT.md`
**Branch:** `feature/bitbucket-integration`
**Focus:** Framework robustness + V2 primitives adoption

---

## Session Accomplishments

### 1. Research Infrastructure ✅
- Created `ai_docs/research/` folder structure
- Indexed IndyDevDan video analysis
- Updated all documentation to reflect new structure

### 2. Git Worktree Parallelization ✅
- Spec: `specs/git-worktree-parallel-agents.md`
- 4 new slash commands:
  - `/init-parallel-worktrees`
  - `/run-parallel-agents`
  - `/compare-worktrees`
  - `/merge-worktree`

### 3. Feedback Loop Structure ✅ (Added Late Session)
- Created `ai_docs/feedback/` with full documentation
- Subdirectories: `predictions/`, `outcomes/`, `corrections/`
- Ready for V2-style continuous learning implementation

### 4. Agentic Primitives V2 Review ✅
- Full review: `ai_docs/reviews/agentic-primitives-v2-review.md`
- Model claims validated (Nov 2025 is accurate)
- Identified gaps: State, Observability, Multi-model, Feedback loops
- Prioritized adoption recommendations

## Pending Action Items (Prioritized)

### IMMEDIATE (Next Session)

| Item | Route | Command/Approach | Effort |
|------|-------|------------------|--------|
| **Create feedback structure** | Quick | `mkdir -p ai_docs/feedback/{predictions,outcomes,corrections}` | 5 min |
| **Multi-model router spec** | ADW-Plan | `/plan_w_docs "Multi-model router"` | 1 hr |
| **Langfuse observability** | ADW-Full | `/scout` → `/plan` → `/build_adw` | 2-3 hrs |

### LATER (Backlog)

- Redis state management (60 hrs)
- MCP adapter integration (40 hrs)
- Vector memory for semantic search
- Drift detection

## Framework Improvement Ideas (Discussed)

### Problem: No Clear Routing
Users don't know which workflow to use (Quick vs ADW vs Research vs Parallel)

### Proposed Solutions:

**Option A: CLAUDE.md Decision Tree**
Add a visual flowchart showing task → workflow mapping

**Option B: Router Skill**
`.claude/skills/workflow-router.md` that outputs deterministic routing

**Option C: Trigger Words**
Deterministic keywords that auto-route:
- "create directory" → Quick
- "add feature" → ADW
- "research" → Explore
- "parallel" → Worktree

### Recommended: Start with Option A
Update CLAUDE.md with decision tree. Low effort, immediate clarity.

.claude/commands/init-parallel-worktrees.md    ← Create N worktrees
.claude/commands/run-parallel-agents.md        ← Run N agents in parallel
.claude/commands/compare-worktrees.md          ← Compare implementations
.claude/commands/merge-worktree.md             ← Merge best implementation
ai_docs/research/README.md                     ← Research folder index
ai_docs/reviews/agentic-primitives-v2-review.md ← V2 review findings
ai_docs/sessions/handoffs/handoff-2024-11-22.md ← Earlier handoff
```

### Reference (Existing)
```
ai_docs/reference/AGENTIC_ENGINEERING_PRIMITIVES_V2.md ← V2 primitives guide
scripts/worktree_manager.sh                    ← Existing worktree management
adws/adw_sdlc.py                               ← Parallel execution pattern
```

## Quick Start Commands for Next Session

```bash
# 1. Quick win - create feedback structure
mkdir -p ai_docs/feedback/{predictions,outcomes,corrections}
echo "# Feedback Loop Storage" > ai_docs/feedback/README.md

# 2. Start Langfuse ADW
/scout "Langfuse observability integration"

# 3. Or enhance CLAUDE.md routing
# Edit CLAUDE.md to add decision tree section
```

## Context for Portability Goal

User wants framework to be:
1. **Robust** - Clear paths, no ambiguity
2. **Simple** - Easy to understand, low friction
3. **Portable** - Works in other repos
4. **Documented** - Self-explanatory
5. **Token-efficient** - No wasted back-and-forth

### Key Insight
The framework has good components but lacks a **clear entry point** that routes users to the right workflow. Adding a decision tree or router would solve this.

## Uncommitted Changes

Run `git status` to see all pending changes including:
- New slash commands (4 files)
- Research folder structure
- Updated documentation
- New specs

**Recommend:** Commit before continuing
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Git worktree parallelization + research infrastructure + V2 review"
```

*Handoff created: 2024-11-22 (end of session)*
*Next agent: Start with Quick win (feedback structure), then choose ADW vs CLAUDE.md enhancement*
