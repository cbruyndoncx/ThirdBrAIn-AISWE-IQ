# Session Checkpoint - Oct 24, 2024

## ✅ What We Fixed This Session
1. **Scout Commands** - Now use Task agents instead of broken external tools
2. **Root Cleanup** - Moved junk files to organized folders
3. **Pipeline Validation** - All components working

## 🚀 System Status: READY

```bash
# Quick validation (run first next session):
scripts/validate_pipeline.sh
```

## 📍 Next Session: Start Here

### Option A: Use It For Real Work
```bash
/scout "your actual task from backlog" "3"
/plan_w_docs "task" "" "scout_outputs/relevant_files.json"
/build_adw "specs/created-spec.md"
```

### Option B: Continue Improvements
Priority fixes remaining:
1. Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh`
2. Add parallelization to scout (2x speedup)
3. Wire memory hooks (30% performance boost)

## 🎯 The Working Commands

| Command | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `/scout "task" "N"` | Find files with N parallel agents | ✅ FIXED |
| `/plan_w_docs` | Create spec from task | ✅ WORKS |
| `/build_adw` | Implement from spec | ✅ WORKS |

## 🧠 Key Learning This Session

**"Don't rewrite, just fix"** - We wasted time creating new scout when commenting out 5 lines would have fixed it.

## 📂 Where Things Are

- Fixed scout: `.claude/commands/scout.md`
- Simple backup scout: `adws/scout_simple.py`
- Our attempts: `docs/mvp_fixes/` and `scripts/mvp_fixes/`
- Validation: `scripts/validate_pipeline.sh`
